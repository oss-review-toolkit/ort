      The error can be ignored because the file does contain relevant license information.

    reason: "INEFFECTIVE_VULNERABILITY"
    comment: >-
      This vulnerability is triggered by the org.springframework:spring-beans package which comes as a transitive
      dependency of the Jira REST client used by the notifier. The vulnerability applies only to Spring MVC or Spring
      WebFlux applications; so it is ineffective for the current usage scenario.

    comment: >-
      This vulnerability is reported for the JRuby dependencies used within the Analyzer and the Reporter. The CVE is
      actually assigned to Bundler which is shipped with JRuby. It is about a possibility to inject malicious code for
      gems hosted on GitHub by deploying packages with same names on RubyGems.org. For the usage in the Reporter, this
      is completely irrelevant. For the Analyzer, the issue does not affect ORT itself, but applications analyzed by
      ORT that use Bundler as package manager.

      This vulnerability is reported for the JRuby dependencies used within the Analyzer and the Reporter. It is
      related to the CGI gem. The version of the gem bundled with JRuby is greater than 0.3.1 and is therefore not
      affected. Since ORT does not use Ruby gems to implement server functionality, this vulnerability is ineffective
      anyway.

      This vulnerability is reported for the jettison package which is a dependency of the Atlassian Jira client used
      by the notifier. The component is vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks causing stack overflow for specially
      crafted parser input. Since it is used here only to parse responses of valid Jira servers, this is not an issue.

      This vulnerability is reported for the jettison package which is a dependency of the Atlassian Jira client used

      This vulnerability is reported for the jettison package which is a dependency of the Atlassian Jira client used
      by the notifier. The component is vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks due to Uncontrolled Recursion for

      an issue.

      This vulnerability is reported for the JRuby dependencies used within the Analyzer and the Reporter. It is
      related to the RXML gem in versions prior to 3.2.5. According to

      3.2.5 of this gem.
