| [Alliander](https://www.alliander.com/en/open-source/) | ospo@alliander.com | Alliander is mainly interested in the security side of the software supply chain. Alliander uses multiple tools and has evaluated even more, but currently ORT is unbeaten. ORT provides accurate and destailed scan results and allows us to define a through policy to use in evaluation. We are currently working to adopt ORT for thorough scans in addition to other tools. We're working with the community to get ORT running in GitHub Actions. |

| [HERE Technologies](https://here.com/) | opensource@here.com | HERE Technologies uses ORT to generate SBOMs for all its products, as well as to manage licensing risks. |
| [Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://scs.community/) | scs@osb-alliance.com | Currently in the process of evaluating how to generate a complete SBOM of our stack and secure the supply chain.
