| Organization | Contact | Description of Use |
|--------------|---------|--------------------|
| [Alliander](https://www.alliander.com/en/open-source/) | ospo@alliander.com | Alliander is mainly interested in the security side of the software supply chain. Alliander uses multiple tools and has evaluated even more, but currently ORT is unbeaten. ORT provides accurate and destailed scan results and allows us to define a through policy to use in evaluation. We are currently working to adopt ORT for thorough scans in addition to other tools. We're working with the community to get ORT running in GitHub Actions. |
| [Deutsche Telekom AG](https://www.telekom.de/) | daniel.eder@magenta.at | Deutsche Telekom is in the process of adopting ORT as part of our CI/CD chain and is working on a custom ORT reporter in our [ORT fork](https://github.com/telekom/ort). |
| [EPAM Systems](https://opensource.epam.com/) | opensource@epam.com | EPAM engineering teams can use ORT to check the licensing and security of their projects and generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). EPAM also uses ORT to help its clients with their Open Source challenges and provides a wide range of commercial support services around ORT. |
| [HERE Technologies](https://here.com/) | opensource@here.com | HERE Technologies uses ORT to generate SBOMs for all its products, as well as to manage licensing risks. |
| [Porsche AG](https://www.porsche.com/) | Open_Source_Office@porsche.de | Porsche AG started using ORT in the year 2020 where we utilize ORT as a core service for FOSS Compliance and FOSS Vulnerability. Our approach is to run ORT as a service decentrally by decoupling logically the analyzer and scanner steps, where the Product Development Team takes the responsibility for running the analyzer and the Open Source Program Office takes the responsibility for running the scanner, curation, and report consolidation for auditing. |
| [Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://scs.community/) | scs@osb-alliance.com | Currently in the process of evaluating how to generate a complete SBOM of our stack and secure the supply chain. We plan to use ORT to analyze our reference implementation as well as to add ORT to our [recommended operator's toolset](https://scs.community/about/#technological-vision). |
