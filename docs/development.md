# Development

ORT is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as the build system, with
[Kotlin script](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) instead of Groovy as the DSL.

When developing on the command line, use the committed
[Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) to bootstrap Gradle in the configured
version and execute any given tasks. The most important tasks for this project are:

| Task        | Purpose                                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| assemble    | Build the JAR artifacts for all projects                          |
| detekt      | Run static code analysis on all projects                          |
| test        | Run unit tests for all projects                                   |
| funTest     | Run functional tests for all projects                             |
| installDist | Build all projects and install the start scripts for distribution |

All contributions need to pass the `detekt`, `test` and `funTest` checks before they can be merged.

For IDE development we recommend the [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) which
can directly import the Gradle build files. After cloning the project's source code recursively, simply run IDEA and use
the following steps to import the project.

1. From the wizard dialog: Select *Import Project*.

   From a running IDEA instance: Select *File* -> *New* -> *Project from Existing Sources...*

2. Browse to ORT's source code directory and select either the `build.gradle.kts` or the `settings.gradle.kts` file.

3. In the *Import Project from Gradle* dialog select *Use auto-import* and leave all other settings at their defaults.

## Debugging

To set up a basic run configuration for debugging, navigate to `OrtMain.kt` in the `cli` module and look for the
`fun main(args: Array<String>)` function. In the gutter next to it, a green "Play" icon should be displayed. Click on it
and select `Run 'OrtMainKt'` to run the entry point, which implicitly creates a run configuration. Double-check that
running ORT without any arguments will simply show the command line help in IDEA's *Run* tool window. Finally, edit the
created run configuration to your needs, e.g. by adding an argument and options to run a specific ORT sub-command.

## Testing

For running tests and individual test cases from the IDE, the [kotest plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14080-kotest)
needs to be installed. Afterwards tests can be run via the green "Play" icon from the gutter as described above.
