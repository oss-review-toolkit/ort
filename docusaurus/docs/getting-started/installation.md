# Installation

## From binaries

Preliminary binary artifacts for ORT are currently available via
[JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#oss-review-toolkit/ort). Please note that due to limitations with the JitPack build
environment, the reporter is not able to create the Web App report.

## From sources

Install the following basic prerequisites:

* Git (any recent version will do).

Then clone this repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort
# If you intend to run tests, you have to clone the submodules too.
cd ort
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Build using Docker

Install the following basic prerequisites:

* Docker 18.09 or later (and ensure its daemon is running).
* Enable [BuildKit](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/#to-enable-buildkit-builds) for
  Docker.

Change into the directory with ORT's source code and run `docker build -t ort .`. Alternatively, use the script at
`scripts/docker_build.sh` which also sets the ORT version from the Git revision.

### Build natively

Install these additional prerequisites:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or later; also remember to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable accordingly.

Change into the directory with ORT's source code and run `./gradlew installDist` (on the first run this will bootstrap
Gradle and download all required dependencies).

## Basic usage

Depending on how ORT was installed, it can be run in the following ways:

* If the Docker image was built, use

  ```shell
  docker run ort --help
  ```

  You can find further hints for using ORT with Docker in the [documentation](./docs/hints-for-use-with-docker.md).

* If the ORT distribution was built from sources, use

  ```shell
  ./cli/build/install/ort/bin/ort --help
  ```

* If running directly from sources via Gradle, use

  ```shell
  ./gradlew cli:run --args="--help"
  ```

  Note that in this case the working directory used by ORT is that of the `cli` project, not the directory `gradlew` is
  located in (see https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/6074).

For simplicity of the following usage examples, the above ORT invocations are unified to just `ort --help`.
