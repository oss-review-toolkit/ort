/**
 * A data class that represents the graph of dependencies of a project.
 *
 * This class holds information about a project's scopes and their dependencies in a format that minimizes the
 * consumption of memory. In projects with many scopes there is often a high degree of duplication in the
 * dependencies of the scopes. To avoid this, this class aims to share as many parts of the dependency graph as
 * possible between the different scopes. Ideally, there is only a single dependency graph containing the dependencies
 * used by all scopes. This is not always possibles due to inconsistencies in dependency relations, like a package
 * using different dependencies in different scopes. Then the dependency graph is split into multiple fragments, and
 * each fragment has a consistent view on the dependencies it contains.
 *
 * When constructing a dependency graph the dependencies are organized as a connected structure of
 * [DependencyReference] objects in memory. Originally, the serialization format of a graph was based on this
 * structure, but that turned out to be not ideal: During serialization, sub graphs referenced from multiple nodes
 * (e.g. libraries with transitive dependencies referenced from multiple projects) get duplicated, which can cause a
 * significant amount of redundancy. Therefore, the data representation has been changed again to a form, which can be
 * serialized without introducing redundancy. It consists of the following elements:
 *
 * - *packages*: A list with the coordinates of all the packages (free of duplication) that are referenced by the
 *   graph. This allows extracting the packages directly, but also has the advantage that the package coordinates do
 *   not have to be repeated over and over: All the references to packages are expressed by indices into this list.
 * - *nodes*: An ordered list with the nodes of the dependency graph. A single node represents a package, and
 *   therefore has a reference into the list with package coordinates. It can, however, happen that packages occur
 *   multiple times in the graph if they are in different subtrees with different sets of transitive dependencies.
 *   Then there are multiple nodes for the packages affected, and a *fragmentIndex* is used to identify them uniquely.
 *   Nodes also store information about issues of a package and their linkage.
 * - *edges*: Here the structure of the graph comes in. Each edge connects two nodes and represents a directed
 *   *depends-on* relationship. The nodes are referenced by numeric indices into the list of *nodes*.
 * - *scopes*: This is a map that associates the scopes used by projects with their direct dependencies. A single
 *   dependency graph contains the dependencies of all the projects processed by a specific package manager.
 *   Therefore, the keys of this map are scope names qualified by the coordinates of a project; which makes them
 *   unique. The values are references to the nodes in the graph that correspond to the packages the scopes depend on
 *   directly.
 *
 * So to navigate this structure, start with a *scope* and gather the references to its direct dependency *nodes*.
 * Then, by following the *edges* starting from these *nodes*, the set of transitive dependencies can be determined.
 * The numeric indices can be resolved via the *packages* list.
