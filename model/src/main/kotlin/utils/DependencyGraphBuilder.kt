/**
 * A class that can construct a [DependencyGraph] from a set of dependencies that provides an efficient storage format
 * for large dependency sets in many scopes.
 *
 * For larger projects the network of transitive dependencies tends to become complex. Single packages can occur many
 * times in this structure if they are referenced by multiple scopes or are fundamental libraries, on which many other
 * packages depend. A naive implementation, which simply duplicates the dependency trees for each scope and package
 * therefore leads to a high consumption of memory. This class addresses this problem by generating an optimized
 * structure that shares the components of the dependency graph between the scopes as far as possible.
 *
 * This builder class provides the _addDependency()_ function, which has to be called for all the direct dependencies
 * of the different scopes. From these dependencies it constructs a single, optimized graph that is referenced by all
 * scopes. To reduce the amount of memory required even further, package identifiers are replaced by numeric indices,
 * so that references in the graph are just numbers.
 *
 * Ideally, the resulting dependency graph contains each dependency exactly once. There are, however, cases, in which
 * packages occur multiple times in the project's dependency graph with different dependencies, for instance if
 * exclusions for transitive dependencies are used or a version resolution mechanism comes into play. In such cases,
 * the corresponding packages need to form different nodes in the graph, so that they can be distinguished, and for
 * packages depending on them, it must be ensured that the correct node is referenced. In the terminology of this class
 * this is referred to as "fragmentation": A fragment is a consistent sub graph, in which each package occurs only
 * once. Packages appearing multiple times with different dependencies need to be placed in separate fragments. It is
 * then possible to uniquely identify a specific package by a combination of its numeric identifier and the index of
 * the fragment it belongs to.
 *
 * This class implements the full logic to construct a [DependencyGraph], independent on the concrete representation of
 * dependencies [D] used by specific package managers. To make this class compatible with such a dependency
 * representation, the package manager implementation has to provide a [DependencyHandler]. Via this handler, all the
 * relevant information about dependencies can be extracted.
