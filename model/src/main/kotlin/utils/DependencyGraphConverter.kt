/**
 * An object that supports the conversion of [AnalyzerResult]s to the dependency graph format.
 *
 * The main conversion function takes an [AnalyzerResult] and iterates over all projects contained in it. Each
 * project that still uses the dependency tree representation (i.e. the set of scopes) is converted, and a dependency
 * graph for the associated package manager is created. During this transformation, scope excludes are applied, so
 * that the result contains only dependencies from included scopes.
 *
 * Via this converter, optimized results can be generated for package managers that do not yet support this format.
 * This approach is, however, not ideal, because during the conversion both the dependency tree and the dependency
 * graph need to be hold in memory. So this is rather a temporary solution until all package managers support the new
 * format natively.
