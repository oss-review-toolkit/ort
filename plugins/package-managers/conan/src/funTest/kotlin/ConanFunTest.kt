/**
 * This test class performs tests with both Conan 1 and Conan 2.
 * TODO: In the current state, both Conan version 2 cannot be run at the same time, because the package manager only
 *  uses one "conan" command.
 *
 * A word of caution about Conan 2 tests: If there is no lockfile, when Conan resolves the dependencies it read its
 * cache and relies on the package name, ignoring the version. This means, for instance, that if a test reported
 * dependency at version 1.3.1, this version will still be reported by "conan graph info" in another test, even if the
 * latter uses a lower version of this dependency. This leads to some side effects when running the tests locally
 * several times (CI checks are not impacted because they always start with an empty cache). A workaround is to delete
 * the Conan cache before executing the tests, i.e. rm -Rf ~/.conan2/p/.
