  description: "Contains Guava's com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture\
    \ class,\n    without any of its other classes -- but is also available in a second\n\
    \    \"version\" that omits the class to avoid conflicts with the copy in Guava\n\
    \    itself. The idea is:\n\n    - If users want only ListenableFuture, they depend\
    \ on listenablefuture-1.0.\n\n    - If users want all of Guava, they depend on\
    \ guava, which, as of Guava\n    27.0, depends on\n    listenablefuture-9999.0-empty-to-avoid-conflict-with-guava.\
    \ The 9999.0-...\n    version number is enough for some build systems (notably,\
    \ Gradle) to select\n    that empty artifact over the \"real\" listenablefuture-1.0\
    \ -- avoiding a\n    conflict with the copy of ListenableFuture in guava itself.\
    \ If users are\n    using an older version of Guava or a build system other than\
    \ Gradle, they\n    may see class conflicts. If so, they can solve them by manually\
    \ excluding\n    the listenablefuture artifact or manually forcing their build\
    \ systems to\n    use 9999.0-...."
