# Synthetic multiproject test

__This test checks that:__

* All of the definition files in subfolders of a multi-project are found.
* Proper package list is created.
* None of files having name that does not match the expected definition file names are considered.

Extra files like the one are created to ensure that only the expected definition files are processed.
