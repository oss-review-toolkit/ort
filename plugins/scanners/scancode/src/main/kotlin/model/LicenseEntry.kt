/**
 * An interface to be able to treat all versions of license entries the same.
 *
 * Note that the data class constructors of the individual version's implementation of this interface should contain
 * only those properties which are actually present in the data, in the order used in the data, to exactly resemble that
 * version's data model. Other properties required to implement the interface should be added to the body of the data
 * class to clearly separate data model properties from "synthetic" interface properties.
