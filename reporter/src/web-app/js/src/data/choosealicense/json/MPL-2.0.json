Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. However, a larger work using the licensed work may be distributed under different terms and without source code for files added in the larger work.",
  "how": "Create a text file (typically named LICENSE or LICENSE.txt) in the root of your source code and copy the text of the license into the file.",
  "note": "The Mozilla Foundation recommends taking the additional step of adding a boilerplate notice to the top of each file. The boilerplate can be found at the end of the license (Exhibit A).",
