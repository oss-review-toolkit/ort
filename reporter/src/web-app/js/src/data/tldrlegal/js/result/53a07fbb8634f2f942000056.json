  "fulltext": "<p>Common Public License Version 1.0</p><p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC <br>LICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM <br>CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p><p>1. DEFINITIONS</p><p>\"Contribution\" means:</p><p>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and <br>documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</p><p>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p><p>i) changes to the Program, and</p><p>ii) additions to the Program;</p><p>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are <br>distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a <br>Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone <br>acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to <br>the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in <br>conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not <br>derivative works of the Program.</p><p>\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.</p><p>\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are <br>necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when <br>combined with the Program.</p><p>\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.</p><p>\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, <br>including all Contributors.</p><p>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</p><p>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants <br>Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to <br>reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, <br>distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such <br>derivative works, in source code and object code form.</p><p>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants <br>Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed <br>Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the <br>Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. <br>This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the <br>Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such <br>addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the <br>Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations <br>which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</p><p>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses <br>to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any <br>Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual <br>property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to <br>Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of <br>intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the <br>rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole <br>responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. <br>For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to <br>distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license <br>before distributing the Program.</p><p>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient <br>copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set <br>forth in this Agreement.</p><p>3. REQUIREMENTS</p><p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its <br>own license agreement, provided that:</p><p>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p><p>b) its license agreement:</p><p>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and <br>conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and <br>non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and <br>fitness for a particular purpose;</p><p>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for <br>damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential <br>damages, such as lost profits;</p><p>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered <br>by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</p><p>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such <br>Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or <br>through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</p><p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p><p>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p><p>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.</p><p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the <br>Program.</p><p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if <br>any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the <br>originator of the Contribution.</p><p>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</p><p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with <br>respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is <br>intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who <br>includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner <br>which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if <br>a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such <br>Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify <br>every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages <br>and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal <br>actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the <br>extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in <br>connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product <br>offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses <br>relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order <br>to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial <br>Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to <br>control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any <br>related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in <br>any such claim at its own expense.</p><p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product <br>offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that <br>Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties <br>related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such <br>Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the <br>Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other <br>Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court <br>requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial <br>Contributor must pay those damages.</p><p>5. NO WARRANTY</p><p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN <br>\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR <br>IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, <br>NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each <br>Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and <br>distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of <br>rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of <br>program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, <br>programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</p><p>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</p><p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY <br>CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, <br>SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST <br>PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, <br>STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY <br>OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS <br>GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p><p>7. GENERAL</p><p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable <br>law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the <br>terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such <br>provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such <br>provision valid and enforceable.</p><p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to <br>a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a <br>lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient <br>under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In <br>addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity <br>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program <br>itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) <br>infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under <br>Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p><p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to <br>comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does <br>not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of <br>such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, <br>Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as <br>reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement <br>and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and <br>survive.</p><p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in <br>order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be <br>modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to <br>publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. <br>No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. <br>IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve <br>as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the <br>Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including <br>Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement <br>under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement <br>is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its <br>Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections <br>2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the <br>intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether <br>expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not <br>expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</p><p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the <br>intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this <br>Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year <br>after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in <br>any resulting litigation.</p>"
