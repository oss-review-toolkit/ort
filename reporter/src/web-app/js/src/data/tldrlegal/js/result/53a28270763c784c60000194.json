This license may be particularly <br>suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but <br>it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is <br>unrelated to TeX.</p><p>The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE', <br>below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors <br>who are considering distributing their works under this license.</p><p>This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed <br>and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of <br>that work may be distributed.</p><p>We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you <br>the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work <br>that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while <br>maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of <br>that work. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while <br>meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' <br>and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.</p><p><br>DEFINITIONS <br>===========</p><p>In this license document the following terms are used:</p><p>`Work' <br>Any work being distributed under this License.</p><p>`Derived Work' <br>Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.</p><p>`Modification' <br>Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable <br>law -- for example, the production of a file containing an <br>original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of <br>such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or <br>translated into another language.</p><p>`Modify' <br>To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any <br>applicable law.</p><p>`Distribution' <br>Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in <br>whole or in part. Distribution includes (but is not limited to) <br>making any electronic components of the Work accessible by <br>file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file <br>systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).</p><p>`Compiled Work' <br>A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it <br>is directly usable on a computer system. This processing may <br>include using installation facilities provided by the Work, <br>transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or <br>other activities. Note that modification of any installation <br>facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.</p><p>`Current Maintainer' <br>A person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If there is <br>no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under <br>any applicable law.</p><p>`Base Interpreter' <br>A program or process that is normally needed for running or <br>interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.</p><p>A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these <br>are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each <br>external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used <br>interactively. Unless explicitly specified when applying the <br>license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a <br>`LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the <br>`LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.</p><p>CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION <br>===========================================</p><p>1. Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work <br>are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In <br>particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no <br>requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.</p><p>2. You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you <br>received it. Distribution of only part of the Work is considered <br>modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived <br>Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.</p><p>3. You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a <br>complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2 <br>above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that <br>the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly <br>as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work <br>directly from the Work.</p><p>4. If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without <br>restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. You may <br>also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including <br>Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works <br>distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to <br>be updated versions of the Work.</p><p>5. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify <br>your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work, <br>and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on <br>the Derived Work.</p><p>6. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may <br>distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met <br>for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states <br>in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only <br>the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption <br>to a component of the Work.</p><p>a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement <br>for a component of the Work when that component is used with the <br>Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work <br>identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that <br>Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work <br>clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version <br>of this component to the user when used interactively with that <br>Base Interpreter.</p><p>b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices <br>detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a <br>prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part <br>of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log <br>of the changes.</p><p>c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons, <br>including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version <br>of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to) <br>the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the <br>Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that <br>they do provide such support for the Derived Work.</p><p>d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:</p><p>1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; <br>if your distribution of a modified component is made by <br>offering access to copy the modified component from a <br>designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy <br>the Work from the same or some similar place meets this <br>condition, even though third parties are not compelled to <br>copy the Work along with the modified component;</p><p>2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, <br>unmodified copy of the Work.</p><p>7. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may <br>distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as <br>the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled <br>Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with <br>regard to the Derived Work.</p><p>8. The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not <br>apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it <br>becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as <br>it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.</p><p>9. Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative <br>format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is <br>then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or <br>nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of <br>applying that process.</p><p>10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license <br>provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in <br>Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have <br>to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.</p><p>b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that <br>Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of <br>itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the <br>restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.</p><p>11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to <br>the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating <br>such works with the Work by any means.</p><p>12. Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent <br>complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.</p><p><br>NO WARRANTY <br>===========</p><p>There is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in <br>writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without <br>warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not <br>limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a <br>particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance <br>of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove defective, you assume <br>the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.</p><p>In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing <br>will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the <br>Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as <br>permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, <br>special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of <br>the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited <br>to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by <br>anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other <br>programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other <br>party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p><p><br>MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK <br>=======================</p><p>The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder <br>explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in <br>the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder <br>or simply that it is `author-maintained'.</p><p>The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer <br>who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error <br>reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail <br>address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge <br>or act upon these error reports.</p><p>The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there <br>is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current <br>Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means <br>of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other <br>significant signs of active maintenance.</p><p>You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with <br>any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.</p><p>If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of <br>the Work through the following steps:</p><p>1. Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and <br>the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of <br>an Internet or similar search.</p><p>2. If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work <br>is still maintained.</p><p>a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer <br>to update their communication data within one month.</p><p>b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active <br>maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce <br>within the pertinent community your intention to take over <br>maintenance. (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be <br>done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)</p><p>3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass <br>maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect <br>immediately upon announcement.</p><p>b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright <br>Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you, <br>then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.</p><p>4. If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above <br>and after three months your intention is challenged neither by <br>the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other <br>people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as <br>to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.</p><p>5. If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes <br>reachable once more within three months of a change completed <br>under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must <br>become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided <br>they then update their communication data within one month.</p><p>A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact <br>that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.</p><p>If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should <br>immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous <br>statement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also <br>announce your new status to the same pertinent community as <br>in 2b) above.</p><p><br>WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE <br>======================================================</p><p>This section contains important instructions, examples, and <br>recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their <br>works under this license. These authors are addressed as `you' in <br>this section.</p><p>Choosing This License or Another License <br>----------------------------------------</p><p>If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution* <br>conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then <br>do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead, <br>distribute your work under a different license. You may use the text <br>of this license as a model for your own license, but your license <br>should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that <br>your work is distributed under the LPPL.</p><p>The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains <br>the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, <br>for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public <br>License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is <br>unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be <br>relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any <br>license are encouraged to read it.</p><p>A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution <br>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own <br>personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for <br>distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such <br>modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by <br>accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or <br>it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified <br>version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions <br>of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse, <br>cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your <br>best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public <br>one. Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work <br>without altering any of its licensed components.</p><p>How to Use This License <br>-----------------------</p><p>To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both <br>an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work <br>was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include also a <br>statement that the distribution and/or modification of that <br>component is constrained by the conditions in this license.</p><p>Here is an example of such a notice and statement:</p><p>%% pig.dtx <br>%% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name <br>% <br>% This work may be distributed and/or modified under the <br>% conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3 <br>% of this license or (at your option) any later version. <br>% The latest version of this license is in <br>% http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt <br>% and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX <br>% version 2005/12/01 or later. <br>% <br>% This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'. <br>% <br>% The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name. <br>% <br>% This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins <br>% and the derived file pig.sty.</p><p>Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions <br>given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring <br>to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being <br>generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter' <br>referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and <br>`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.</p><p>If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your <br>Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'. <br>However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance <br>section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to <br>the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it <br>yourself.</p><p>Derived Works That Are Not Replacements <br>---------------------------------------</p><p>Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and <br>stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves <br>with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a <br>(compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If <br>this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a <br>completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.</p><p><br>Important Recommendations <br>-------------------------</p><p>Defining What Constitutes the Work</p><p>The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the <br>files of the Work. It is therefore important that you provide a <br>way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. <br>This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the <br>files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by <br>using a line such as:</p><p>% This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.</p><p>in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be <br>impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you <br>to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be <br>entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise <br>the Work.</p>"
