Please note that Section 17 contains certain changes to the general terms for users outside the United States.</p><p>Date of Last Revision: November 15, 2013.<br><br><strong>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</strong><br><br>This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (\"Statement,\" \"Terms,\" or \"SRR\") derives from the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/principles.php\">Facebook Principles</a>, and is our terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 14 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how Facebook works.</p><ol>\r\n<li><strong>Privacy</strong><br><br>Your privacy is very important to us.

This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</li><li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</li><li>When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others have shared with you.
