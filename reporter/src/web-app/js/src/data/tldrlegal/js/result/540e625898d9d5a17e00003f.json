Additionally, Riot Games may stop offering and/or supporting the Game at any time. For purposes of explanation and not limitation, most Account suspensions, terminations and/or deletions are the result of violation of this Agreement, the <a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/eula\">EULA</a>, the <a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a>, or the <a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/articles/The_Summoners_Code\">Summoner’s Code</a> (defined below). Accounts terminated by Riot Games shall not be reinstated under any conditions whatsoever.</li><li><strong>By You.</strong> <strong></strong>You may terminate your Account at any time, for any reason or no reason, by contacting Riot Games at <a href=\"mailto:support@riotgames.com\">support@riotgames.com</a>.</li><li><strong>By the Community via Crowd Sourcing</strong><strong>.</strong> Riot Games has empowered its community of users (the “<strong>Community</strong>”) to police the compliance of other users with the “<strong>Summoner’s Code</strong>” (<a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/articles/The_Summoners_Code\"></a><a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/articles/The_Summoners_Code\">http://na.leagueoflegends.com/articles/The_Summoners_Code</a>), which outlines the principles of ideal game play behavior, as well as with other Riot Games policies. Consistent with the guidelines found at <a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/tribunal\">http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/tribunal</a>, Community members, including you as a user, are allowed to submit descriptions of activity and actions of certain users within the Game, and collectively determine if that particular user was in compliance with the Riot Games policies relating to user conduct, including, but not limited to, the <a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/articles/The_Summoners_Code\">Summoner’s Code</a> and the Code of Conduct (defined below). This system of allowing the Community to review user behavior in the Game is called <strong>The Tribunal®</strong>. Should The Tribunal determine that you have acted in contravention of any one of the Riot Games policies, Riot Games may, in its sole and absolute discretion, ban your use of the Game and suspend, terminate and/or delete your Account.</li></ol><p><a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/eula\">EULA</a> or this Agreement, is expressly prohibited by law and may result in severe civil and criminal penalties.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, Riot Games may make a \"fan kit\" available to you (which may be located on the Site) that includes a limited license to use certain Riot Games Marks and other proprietary material. Except for the license expressly granted with the \"fan kit,\" Riot Games reserves all rights, title, and interest in Riot Games Marks and all other intellectual property, and does not authorize you to display or use such in any manner, including but not limited to use on websites, on blogs, in forums, in signatures, on products, or in printed or electronic publications.</p><p>B. <strong>Game Assets, Riot Points and Virtual Items.</strong> When using the Game, you may accumulate in-Game assets associated with your Account, including, without limitation, objects, artifacts, currency, items, equipment, and/or other value or status indicators (“<strong>Game Assets</strong>”) that reside on servers operated by Riot Games as data. You acknowledge and agree that such Game Assets are accumulated as part of your Account and therefore you shall have no ownership or other property interest in any of those Game Assets. You further acknowledge and agree that Riot Games has the right, but not the obligation, to delete, alter, move, remove, or transfer any and all Game Assets, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, with or without notice to you, and with no liability of any kind to you. Riot Games does not provide or guarantee, and expressly disclaims any value, cash or otherwise, attributed to any data residing on servers operated by Riot Games, including without limitation the Game Assets associated with your Account.</p><p>If you have a valid, active Account, you may participate in our Riot Points service offering, which is a redeemable point system that operates like virtual currency (“<strong>Riot Points</strong>”) used to license certain Game Assets that can be used while playing the Game, including, without limitation, special champions, champion “skins,” and boosts (“<strong>Virtual Items</strong>”). Riot Points can be purchased online through the in-Game store or at retail in the form of a prepaid Riot Games Game Card. Please note that you must register your Riot Games Game Card in the in-Game store in order to access the Riot Points the card contains. Riot Points might also be provided to you by Riot Games as part of a promotion, or through other means, such as completing certain quests or achievements in the Game, or through Riot Games-sponsored contests or sweepstakes. You agree that you will be solely responsible for paying any applicable taxes related to the acquisition of, use of or access to Riot Points. Riot Points are sold or issued in bundles and the price may vary depending on the amount you purchase and where you are purchasing. As Riot Games feels necessary, in its sole and absolute discretion, Riot Games may limit the total amount of Riot Points that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total Riot Points that may be held in your Account in the aggregate. Riot Games will notify you in the event that you near any such limit. Additionally, price and availability of Riot Points and/or Virtual Items are subject to change without notice.</p><p>You are solely responsible for verifying that the proper amount of Riot Points has been added to or deducted from your Account during any given transaction, so please notify Riot Games immediately should you believe that a mistake has been made with respect to your Riot Points balance. Riot Games will investigate your claim, and in doing so, may request some additional information and/or documentation to verify your claim. Riot Games will let you know the results of the investigation, however, you acknowledge and agree that Riot Games has sole and absolute discretion in determining whether or not your claim is valid, and if so, the appropriate remedy.</p><p>YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE RIOT POINTS SYSTEM AND THE VIRTUAL ITEMS YOU ACQUIRE HAVE NO MONETARY VALUE AND CANNOT BE REDEEMED FOR CASH. NO REFUNDS WILL BE MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF RIOT POINTS OR FOR VIRTUAL ITEMS OBTAINED USING RIOT POINTS. Some Virtual Items you obtain may have expiration dates while others do not, and each Virtual Item you obtain using Riot Points will be included in your Account until the earlier of that Virtual Item’s expiration date, or your Account’s expiration or termination date, or such date when Riot Games ceases to offer or support the Game.</p><p>The sale or transfer of Virtual Items or Riot Points between users may only be conducted via services approved of and provided by Riot Games, if any, and Riot Games may terminate any Account that acts in contravention of this prohibition.</p><p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN YOUR ACCOUNT, AND YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO THE ACCOUNT ARE AND SHALL FOREVER BE OWNED BY AND INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF RIOT GAMES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO CLAIM, RIGHT, TITLE, OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN THE GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR RIOT POINTS THAT YOU ACQUIRE, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR RIOT POINTS OR VIRTUAL ITEMS. FURTHERMORE, RIOT GAMES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE DESTRUCTION, DELETION, MODIFICATION, IMPAIRMENT, “HACKING,” OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR LOSS OF ANY KIND CAUSED TO THE GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR RIOT POINTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE DELETION OF GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR RIOT POINTS UPON THE TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT.</p><p><strong>C.

Neither Riot Games nor any of its employees and/or contractors accept or consider unsolicited ideas, original creative artwork or other works, including, without limitation, ideas or suggestions for new or improved games or technologies, game or product enhancements, marketing plans or names for new games (collectively “<strong>Unsolicited Ideas</strong>”).

To the extent necessary, you agree that you undertake to execute and deliver any and all documents and perform any and all actions necessary or desirable to ensure that the rights to use the Unsolicited Ideas granted to Riot Games as specified above are valid, effective and enforceable. You also give up any claim that any use by Riot Games and/or its licensees of your Unsolicited Ideas violates any of your rights, including but not limited to moral rights, privacy rights, rights to publicity, proprietary or other rights, and/or rights to credit for the material or ideas set for therein.</p><p><a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/articles/The_Summoners_Code\">Summoner’s Code</a> for additional guidance on exemplary game-play behavior. The following are examples of behavior that warrant disciplinary measures:</p><p>A.

Riot Games’ automated <strong>Leaverbuster</strong>® system tracks this data overtime and issues a temporary ban when a user is determined to have left mid-game too many times. The length of the temporary ban will increase over time if a particular Account continues to leave live game play.</p><p><a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/tribunal\">The Tribunal policy</a>.

You understand that much of the information included in the Forums is from other players who are not employed by or under the control of Riot Games. You further acknowledge that a large volume of information is available in the Forums and that people participating in such Forums may occasionally post messages or make statements, whether intentionally or unintentionally, that are inaccurate, misleading, deceptive, abusive or even unlawful. Riot Games neither endorses nor is responsible for such messages or statements, or for any opinion, advice, information or other utterance made or displayed in the Forums by you or the other users.

When you disclose any information in a Forum, you do so at your own risk. Riot Games reserves the right to, but has no obligation to, monitor the Forums, or any postings or other materials that you or other players transmit or post on the Forums, to alter or remove any such materials, and to disclose such materials and the circumstances surrounding their transmission to any third party in order to operate the Site properly or to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests.</p><p><a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/eula\">EULA</a> and <a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a>, at any time, and the new versions will be available on the Site.

This email address is intended solely for the receipt of said notices and not for general inquiries or requests of Riot Games. Attachments cannot be accepted at the email address for security reasons. Accordingly, any notification of infringement submitted electronically with an attachment will not be received or processed. Please note that these notifications are legal notices, and that Riot Games may provide copies of such notices to the participants in the dispute or to third parties, at its discretion or as required by law. The <a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a> does not protect information provided in these notices.</p><p><a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/eula\">EULA</a> OR THE<a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/LEGAL/PRIVACY\">PRIVACY POLICY</a>. Riot Games reserves the right, at its own expense and in its sole and absolute discretion, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with Riot Games in asserting any available defenses.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.adr.org/\">www.adr.org</a>. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section XV.B and either the AAA Rules or the AAA Consumer Rules, the terms in this Section XV.B will control and prevail.</p><p>Except as otherwise set forth in Section XV.F, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and Riot Games will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) you and Riot Games may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision is final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.</p><p>BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND RIOT GAMES ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</p><p><strong>C. Arbitration Fees.</strong> If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by the AAA Rules for initiating the arbitration. Your share of all other fees and costs of the arbitration, including your share of arbitrator compensation, will be charged pursuant to the AAA Rules, and where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. Where your share of the costs is deemed to be excessive by the arbitrator, Riot Games will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.</p><p><strong>D. Location.</strong> The arbitration will take place in your hometown area if you so notify Riot Games in your notice of arbitration or within ten (10) days following receipt of Riot Games’ arbitration notice. In the absence of a notice to conduct the arbitration in your hometown area, the arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles, California, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances. Any Claim not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction in Los Angeles, California, United States of America, and you and Riot Games agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p><p><strong>E.</strong> <strong>Limitations.</strong> You and Riot Games agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between Riot Games and you individually. YOU AND RIOT GAMES AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.</p><p><strong>F. Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration.</strong> You and Riot Games agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Riot Games’ intellectual property rights; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.</p><p><strong>G. Governing Law.</strong> Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Other laws may apply if you choose to access the Game from outside of the United States. In such an event, those local laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent necessary in that jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions in this Agreement. You are responsible for compliance with all local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 (the “<strong>Act</strong>”) may apply to the Game if you access the Game from, and are a resident of, New Zealand. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Act applies then you may have other rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to or instead of those set out in this Agreement.</p><p><strong>H. Severability.</strong> You and Riot Games agree that if any portion this Section XV is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section XV.F), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section XV.F is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Riot Games will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section XV.F found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Los Angeles, State of California, United States of America, and you and Riot Games agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p><p><a href=\"mailto:support@riotgames.com\">support@riotgames.com</a> as stated above. Upon termination of this Agreement, your right to use the Properties shall immediately cease.</p><p><a href=\"mailto:support@riotgames.com\">support@riotgames.com</a>, or visit the “support” tab on the Site.</p><p><strong>C. Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement represents the complete agreement between you and Riot Games concerning the Site, the Game, and the subject matter of the Agreement, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and Riot Games; provided however that this Agreement shall coexist with, and shall not supersede, the <a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/eula\">EULA</a> or the <a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><p><strong>D. Force Majeure.</strong> Riot Games shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of Riot Games, including, without limitation, any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond Riot Games’ control such as acts of god, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.</p><p><strong>E. Location.</strong> The Site and the Game are operated by Riot Games in the United States. Those who choose to access the Site and/or the Game from locations outside the United States do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. The Software is subject to United States export controls as set forth in the <a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/eula\">EULA</a>.</p><p><strong>F. No Partnership.</strong> You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Riot Games as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Site or the Game.</p><p><strong>G. No Waiver.</strong> Riot Games’ failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by Riot Games of any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.</p><p><strong>H. Notices.</strong> Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices given by you or required under this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to: Riot Games, Inc., 10736 Jefferson Blvd., #622, Culver City, CA 90230.</p><p><strong>I. Reform and Severability.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If, however, it is determined that such provision cannot be reformed, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p><p><strong>J. Section Headings.</strong> The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement or have any other legal effect.</p><p><strong>K. Survival.</strong> The provisions of Sections IV, VI.A, IX, XI-XV, and XVII shall survive any termination of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FOREGOING TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT AND AGREE THAT SELECTING THE “ACCEPT” BUTTON BELOW AND/OR YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE PROPERTIES IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF YOUR AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.</strong></p>"
