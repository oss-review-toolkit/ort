The Agreement is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and Zebra Technologies International, LLC (\"Zebra\") for the Zebra computer software accompanying this End User License Agreement (\"Software\"), and any associated media, printed materials and any \"online\" or electronic documentation (\"Documentation\") (the Software and Documentation collectively, the \"ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK\"). By installing or using the ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, you may not install or use the ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK.</p><p>1. Grant of License. The ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and international treaties. The ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK is licensed to you, and not sold, subject to the terms of this Agreement. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Zebra hereby grants you a limited, personal, non-exclusive license during the term of this Agreement to use the Software (in object code format only) and Documentation solely and exclusively for your internal use to create software applications for a digital electronic device solely for operation with Zebra printer(s) (\"Your Applications\") and for no other purpose. To the extent that the ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK includes sample code, Zebra grants you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, modify and create derivative works (\"Derivative Works\") of such sample code for the sole purpose of developing Your Applications and to incorporate object code format versions of such Derivative Works in Your Applications, and for no other purpose. You may distribute Software (in object code format only) to third parties solely in connection with distribution of Your Applications, and further provided that any such distribution is subject to an end user license agreement containing restrictions no less protective of Zebra's (or its licensors') rights in the Software than those contained herein. To the extent that any portion of the ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK is provided to you in a manner that is designed to be installed by you, you may install a limited number of copies of the installable ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK on your computers, workstations, terminals, or other digital electronic devices, as applicable (an \"Electronic Device\"). You agree not to duplicate or copy the ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK, except that you may make a reasonable number of back-up copies for archive purposes. The primary user of the Electronic Device on which installable ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK is installed may also make a copy for his or her exclusive use on a portable computer, so long as such ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK is being used only on one Electronic Device at a time.</p><p>2. Device-Specific Software; Third party software. You acknowledge that Your Application may require libraries or other software from digital electronic device vendors or digital electronic device operating system vendors (each a \"Vendor\"), including Research in Motion Ltd. or Microsoft Corp., to operate, and that you are responsible for obtaining any such software from such Vendor (\"Vendor Software\") and complying with any conditions, license terms or other requirements from such Vendor on use and/or distribution of such Vendor Software (\"Vendor License Terms\"). You represent and warrant to Zebra that (i) you have read such Vendor License Terms, (ii) that your use of the Vendor Software will be in compliance with any such Vendor License Terms, (iii) that you agree to only use such Vendor Software with digital electronic devices and/or operating systems provided or authorized by such Vendor, and (iv) hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Zebra from any claims against Zebra related to your breach of these restrictions or such Vendor License Terms. You also acknowledge that Vendor may make changes to the Vendor Software that may be incompatible with the Software, and that the Software may not work 100% correctly with the Vendor Software, and that you are responsible for testing Your Applications. You acknowledge that the ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK may include third-party software components that may be subject to additional licensing terms located in the installation directory of the ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK.</p><p>3. Storage/Network Use. In the alternative, you may install a copy of the ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK on a storage device, such as a network server, used only to access and use the ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK on your Electronic Devices over an internal network; however, you must acquire and dedicate a license for each separate Electronic Device on which the ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK is accessed and used from the storage device. A license for the ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK may not be shared or used concurrently on different Electronic Devices.</p><p>4. Documentation.

To the extent you have access to any such information, you agree to use such information only for the authorized use of the ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK. You further agree not to disclose such confidential information to any other party and to use at least the same degree of care to maintain the confidential nature of such information as you use to maintain the confidentiality of your own confidential information.</p><p>8.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. WHEN THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE EXCLUDED IN THEIR ENTIRETY, THEY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE DURATION OF NINETY (90) DAYS.

Zebra Suppliers and Licensors. Any release, disclaimer or limitation of Zebra's liability or damages pursuant to this Agreement shall be construed, in addition to Zebra's benefit, also to the benefit of any Vendor, any merchant of record from whom the ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK is acquired, Zebra's suppliers, licensors, employees, and contractors and, without limiting any other defenses that such suppliers, licensors, employees and contractors may have, you agree to release such parties from liability or damages in accordance with such release, disclaimer, or limitation of liability or damages to the same extent that such provisions apply to Zebra.</p><p>19. Governing Law. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the laws of the State of Illinois, U.S.A., without reference to its conflict of laws provisions, will apply to this Agreement. You irrevocably agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in the State of Illinois in the event of any litigation involving this Agreement or the ZebraLink Multiplatform SDK. You agree that you shall not assert any claim that you are not subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, that the venue is improper, that the forum is inconvenient or any similar objection, claim or argument. Zebra may, in its sole discretion, choose to resolve any controversy or dispute between you and Zebra concerning this Agreement, or the existence, validity, breach or termination thereof, whether during or after the term by binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified or supplemented under this Section 15, by providing notice to you. In the event that Zebra provides such notice, you hereby waive any right to institute a court or other dispute resolution proceeding with respect to such controversy or dispute and acknowledge arbitration in accordance with this Section 15 as the sole and exclusive means of resolving such controversy or dispute. The arbitration proceeding will take place in Chicago, Illinois and be conducted in the English language. The arbitration panel will consist of 3 arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party and a third neutral arbitrator appointed by the two arbitrators designated by the parties. Any communication between a party and any arbitrator will be directed to the AAA for transmittal to the arbitrator. The parties expressly agree that the arbitrators will be empowered to, at either party�s request, grant injunctive relief. The arbitral award will be the exclusive remedy of the parties for all claims, counterclaims, issues or accountings presented or pleaded to the arbitrators. Judgment upon the arbitral award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction thereof. Any additional costs, fees or expenses incurred in enforcing the arbitral award will be charged against the party that resists its enforcement. Nothing in this Section will prevent Zebra from seeking interim injunctive relief against you or filing an action against you to collect unpaid and past due amounts in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>20. Injunctive Relief. You acknowledge that, in the event you breach any provision of this Agreement, Zebra will not have an adequate remedy in money or damages. Zebra shall therefore be entitled to obtain an injunction against such breach from any court of competent jurisdiction immediately upon request without posting bond. Zebra's right to obtain injunctive relief shall not limit its right to seek further remedies.</p><p>21. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of the parties and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous representations, understandings and agreements between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p><p>22. Assignment. You may not assign this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations hereunder (by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of Zebra. Zebra may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations without your consent. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to it and their respective legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.</p><p>23. Modification. No modification of this Agreement shall be binding unless it is in writing and is signed by an authorized representative of the party against whom enforcement of the modification is sought.</p><p>24. Waiver. The failure by a party to exercise any right hereunder shall not operate as a waiver of such party's right to exercise such right or any other right in the future.</p><p>25. QUESTIONS.
