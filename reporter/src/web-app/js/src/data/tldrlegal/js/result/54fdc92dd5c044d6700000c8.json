  "fulltext": "<h1>Factual Terms of Service</h1><ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2><p>By using the website at www.factual.com or any portion of the site (the \"Site\") or any related services provided by Factual Inc. (including but not limited to APIs, embeds, and other off-site functionality) (the \"Services\"), you are agreeing to these Terms of Service. You also may be subject to additional guidelines, rules, policies or other terms of service posted on portions of the site. The Site and Services are only available to individuals who (a) are at least 13 years old and (b) either 18 years old or possess legal parental or guardian consent. Factual may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these Terms of Service at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. We will notify you by making the revised version available on this web page, and an updated revision date will indicate that changes have been made.</p></li><li>\r\n<h2>Registration & Passwords</h2><p>To use some of the features on the Site or Services, including the Factual API, you may be required to create an account. Any required fields that are submitted as part of the registration process must be accurate and complete. You are solely responsible for activity that occurs on your account. You should keep your password and/or API key confidential and agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. We reserve the right to close your account at any time for any or no reason.</p></li><li>\r\n<h2>Additional Terms & Guidelines:</h2><p>When using the Site or Services, you will be subject to any additional posted guidelines or rules applicable to specific services and features which may be posted from time to time (the \"Guidelines\"). All such Guidelines are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms. <strong>Such additional terms and guidelines include third-party licenses that may apply to other data on Factual (below).</strong></p></li><li>\r\n<h2>Your Contribution and Use of Data and Content</h2><ul>\r\n<li><strong>Data.</strong> Raw data, facts, and general ideas are not protected by copyright law. You acknowledge that Factual may host, serve, reproduce, distribute, and allow the modification of data uploaded and made publicly available in connection with the Site or Services, and that other Factual users may reproduce, distribute, modify, manipulate, or build upon such data. Likewise, you may reproduce, distribute, modify, and manipulate or build upon data publicly available on Factual, subject to all conditions and disclaimers in these Terms of Use. Notwithstanding the above, and for the avoidance of doubt, Factual's Privacy Policy describes how we use and protect publicly unavailable privacy-related data associated with your and other users' use of Factual.</li><li><strong>Content.</strong> To the extent you lawfully contribute original copyrightable content (as distinguished from raw or underlying facts, data, and ideas) to Factual, you grant Factual a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license to host, serve, reproduce, distribute, and develop derivative works of such content. Also, in some cases, the use of certain content may be subject to a third-party agreement (e.g. a Creative Commons license); it is your responsibility to honor such agreements including, where applicable, to make others aware of any agreements conditioning your or their use, distribution, or manipulation of such content.</li></ul></li><li>By using the Site you represent and warrant that any User Content posted by you does not contain material or links to material that infringes upon a third party's intellectual property or proprietary rights including, without limitation, copyright, patent, trademark, trade secrets, or rights of publicity or privacy. You further represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights and authority to provide and have posted on the Site the User Content, and to transfer such ownership of such User Content to Factual, and that Factual has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit or remove any activity or User Content. You agree to accept full liability and responsibility for all User Content submitted by you or on your behalf for posting on the Site. You further acknowledge that the above language does not govern your use of Factual-owned content, marks, intellectual property, and other elements of the Site and Services. Section 9 below (\"Proprietary Rights and Trademark\") applies to such Factual-owned materials.</li><li>\r\n<h2>Prohibited uses.</h2><p>By using the Site or Services, you agree not to:</p><ul>\r\n<li>*upload any material that:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>infringes on any copyright or other intellectual property right of any other person or entity;</li><li>is illegal, defamatory, libelous, deceptive, fraudulent, obscene or offensive;</li><li>would be considered spam, unsolicited advertising or low quality data uploaded for the purpose of harming services;</li><li>contains software viruses or other code designed to disrupt computing services;</li><li>as uploaded violates a valid third-party agreement;</li></ul></li><li>*take any action that interferes or may interfere, based on our sole discretion, with operations of the Site or Services, including but not limited to:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>placing an unreasonable load on Factual infrastructure;</li><li>circumventing security features used to prevent or restrict access to or use of the Site or Services;</li><li>creating user accounts by automated means;</li><li>impersonating any person or entity;</li><li>using the Site or Services for any illegal purpose;</li><li>using any embeddable or syndicatable features of the Site or Services in a way that alters or circumvents how Factual designed such features to be used;</li><li>using of any embeddable or syndicatable features of the Site or Services for the primary purpose of gaining advertising or subscription revenue.</li><li>selling, reselling, redistributing, or sublicensing the Services or otherwise charging third parties for access to the Site or Services. For the avoidance of doubt, these commercial restrictions do not generally apply to data and content accessed via the Services, but rather to the use of the Services themselves — except in certain circumstances noted above (see “Your Contribution and Use of Data and Content”).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>\r\n<h2>API Usage</h2><p>API enables you to programmatically access portions of the Services enabling the development of applications. As noted above, any use of the API constitutes use of the Services and any use of the API is governed by these Factual Terms of Service. You agree to make users of any third-party applications aware of these terms via a commercially reasonable manner, and you acknowledge that third-party uses of any applications you create from the Factual API shall be bound by these Terms of Service. You agree not to impose any terms or conditions that conflict with these Terms of Service on such third-party uses. For the avoidance of doubt, materials lawfully uploaded to and made available on Factual via Factual API-based applications you develop shall be governed by these terms of use, and you agree not to encumber or restrict such contributions to Factual in any way that contradicts these terms. You agree to display the Factual ID in machine readable format on any pages where Factual Data is incorporated.</p><p><strong>Additional terms for API usage:</strong> Factual may at its sole discretion restrict and limit access to API calls. You agree to abide by these limitations (such as daily usage quotas). You agree not to use methods (such as using multiple IP addresses) to get around these limitations. You also agree to make reasonable good faith efforts to ensure that others' uses of any tools or software you create that use the Factual API do not result in any of the prohibited uses under these Terms of Service. Factual, in its sole discretion, may at any time change the specifications of or restrict or limit access to the APIs. Factual may suspend or throttle Services until we believe the number of API calls will not exceed capacity limitations. You will not take steps to circumvent any technical measures Factual may put in place to implement throttling or suspension. You may not use the Site or the Factual API for customer or lead generation, general marketing and sales research, inclusion in paid services or real-time ad targeting (<a href=\"http://www.factual.com/contact\">Contact Factual</a> if you are interested in any of these use cases). Factual reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge fees for use of or access to specific levels of service around the Factual API or any portion of the services provided by it. If Factual decides to charge fees for Services, such fees and additional terms and conditions will be disclosed to you prior to the effective date when such fees or requirements would be imposed. If you do not agree to such charges at the time of the fee disclosure, simply discontinue your use of the Factual API. You may not use any portion of the services or data provided to you through the Factual API to (a) offer any product or service that competes with Factual, (b) provide third parties with any of the data except in conjunction with a product or service of your own, or (c) provide any of the data to third parties in bulk. You may not systematically query the Factual API in a manner to obtain and cache all Data for a given locality, Region or Country. Factual does allow for caching and storing of data provided through the Factual API, provided you delete data in compliance with all expiry headers, but encourages use of the Factual API and others services that provide more accurate and up-to-date values.</p><p><strong>API Termination:</strong> Your license to Factual APIs under these Terms of Service continues until terminated by you or Factual. You may terminate the license by discontinuing use of the APIs. We may terminate the license to the APIs without liability at any time for any reason, with or without notice. Additionally, your rights to use the APIs will terminate immediately if you violate any of the terms and conditions herein. Upon expiration or termination of the license granted herein, you will discontinue any and all use of the Factual APIs. You agree that all information or data of any kind, whether text, software, code, music or sound, photographs or graphics, video or other materials (\"content\"), made available publicly or privately, will be under the sole responsibility of the person providing the said content, or of the person whose user account is used. You agree that this web site may expose you to content that may be objectionable or offensive. The site editor will not be responsible to you in any way for content displayed on this web site, nor for any error or omission.</p></li><li>\r\n<h2>Privacy Policy</h2><p>We respect the privacy of our users.
