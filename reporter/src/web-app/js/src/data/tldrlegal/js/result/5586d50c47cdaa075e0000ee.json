Your rights to use the Software and Documentation shall be limited to those expressly granted in this EULA and any applicable Order. No other rights with respect to the Software or any related Intellectual Property Rights are implied.

WARRANTIES.</strong> <br><br><strong>7.1 Software Warranty, Duration and Remedy.</strong> VMware warrants to You that the Software will, for a period of ninety (90) days following notice of availability for electronic download or delivery (“Warranty Period”), substantially conform to the applicable Documentation, provided that the Software: (a) has been properly installed and used at all times in accordance with the applicable Documentation; and (b) has not been modified or added to by persons other than VMware or its authorized representative. VMware will, at its own expense and as its sole obligation and Your exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty, either replace that Software or correct any reproducible error in that Software reported to VMware by You in writing during the Warranty Period. If VMware determines that it is unable to correct the error or replace the Software, VMware will refund to You the amount paid by You for that Software, in which case the License for that Software will terminate. <br><br><strong>7.2 Software Disclaimer of Warranty.</strong> OTHER THAN THE WARRANTY ABOVE, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, VMWARE AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO OTHER EXPRESS WARRANTIES UNDER THIS EULA, AND DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTY ARISING BY STATUTE, OPERATION OF LAW, COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE. VMWARE AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT IT WILL BE FREE FROM DEFECTS OR THAT IT WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS. <br><br><strong>8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION.</strong> <br><br><strong>8.1 Defense and Indemnification.</strong> Subject to the remainder of this Section 8 (Intellectual Property Indemnification), VMware shall defend You against any third party claim that the Software infringes any patent, trademark or copyright of such third party, or misappropriates a trade secret (but only to the extent that the misappropriation is not a result of Your actions) under the laws of: (a) the United States and Canada; (b) the European Economic Area; (c) Australia; (d) New Zealand; (e) Japan; or (f) the People’s Republic of China, to the extent that such countries are part of the Territory for the License (“Infringement Claim”) and indemnify You from the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against You to such third party by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to in settlement. The foregoing obligations are applicable only if You: (i) promptly notify VMware in writing of the Infringement Claim; (ii) allow VMware sole control over the defense for the claim and any settlement negotiations; and (iii) reasonably cooperate in response to VMware requests for assistance. You may not settle or compromise any Infringement Claim without the prior written consent of VMware. <br><br><strong>8.2 Remedies.</strong> If the alleged infringing Software become, or in VMware’s opinion be likely to become, the subject of an Infringement Claim, VMware will, at VMware’s option and expense, do one of the following: (a) procure the rights necessary for You to make continued use of the affected Software; (b) replace or modify the affected Software to make it non-infringing; or (c) terminate the License to the affected Software and discontinue the related support services, and, upon Your certified deletion of the affected Software, refund: (i) the fees paid by You for the License to the affected Software, less straight-line depreciation over a three (3) year useful life beginning on the date such Software was delivered; and (ii) any pre-paid service fee attributable to related support services to be delivered after the date such service is stopped. Nothing in this Section 8.2 (Remedies) shall limit VMware’s obligation under Section 8.1 (Defense and Indemnification) to defend and indemnify You, provided that You replace the allegedly infringing Software upon VMware’s making alternate Software available to You and/or You discontinue using the allegedly infringing Software upon receiving VMware’s notice terminating the affected License. <br><br><strong>8.3 Exclusions.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, VMware will have no obligation under this Section 8 (Intellectual Property Indemnification) or otherwise with respect to any claim based on: (a) a combination of Software with non-VMware products (other than non-VMware products that are listed on the Order and used in an unmodified form); (b) use for a purpose or in a manner for which the Software was not designed; (c) use of any older version of the Software when use of a newer VMware version would have avoided the infringement; (d) any modification to the Software made without VMware’s express written approval; (e) any claim that relates to open source software or freeware technology or any derivatives or other adaptations thereof that is not embedded by VMware into Software listed on VMware’s commercial price list; or (f) any Software provided on a no charge, beta or evaluation basis. THIS SECTION 8 (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION) STATES YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND VMWARE’S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS OR ACTIONS. <br><br><strong>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong> <br><br><strong>9.1 Limitation of Liability.</strong> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT MANDATED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL VMWARE AND ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE PRECEDING LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. VMWARE’S AND ITS LICENSORS’ LIABILITY UNDER THIS EULA WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM IS BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE LICENSE FEES YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR $5000. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER VMWARE OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. <br><br><strong>9.2 Further Limitations.</strong> VMware’s licensors shall have no liability of any kind under this EULA and VMware’s liability with respect to any third party software embedded in the Software shall be subject to Section 9.1 (Limitation of Liability).
