Apple reserves the right to modify the terms, conditions, and policies of this Beta Program from time to time, and to revoke your participation in this Beta Program at any time. If Apple makes changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then Apple will present such revised terms and conditions to you on the Beta Program web portal.</p><p>By participating in the Beta Program, You certify that you are of the legal age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside (at least 18 years of age in many countries) and you represent that you are legally permitted to join the Beta Program.
