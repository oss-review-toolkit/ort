You agree to receive such updates (and permit YouTube to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Uploader.</li><li>You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, \"robots,\" \"spiders,\" or \"offline readers,\" that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials.

You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 5(D), your DMCA notice may not be valid.</p></li><li>Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li><li>Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li><li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and</li><li>Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in San Francisco, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li></ul><p>If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, YouTube may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days.
