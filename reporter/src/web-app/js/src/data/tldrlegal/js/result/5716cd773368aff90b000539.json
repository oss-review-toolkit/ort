If you are accepting the terms of this EULA on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to the terms of this EULA, and, in such event, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity. If you do not accept all the terms of this EULA, then GoPro is unwilling to license the Software to you, and you must destroy all copies of the Software.<br> <br>1. GRANT OF LICENSE.  Conditioned upon your compliance with the terms and conditions of this EULA, GoPro grants to you a non-exclusive and non-transferable license for a single user to load, install and run one machine readable copy of the Software on a single computer, solely for your personal or internal business use. You may make a single copy of the Software for backup purposes, provided that you reproduce on it all copyright and other proprietary notices that are on the original copy of the Software. GoPro reserves all rights in the Software not expressly granted to you in this EULA.<br><br>2. LICENSE RESTRICTIONS.  Except as expressly and unambiguously permitted by this EULA, you shall not: (a) copy (except in the course of loading or installing) or modify the Software, including, but not limited to, adding new features or otherwise making adaptations that alter the functioning of the Software; (b) transfer, sublicense, rent, lease, sublicense, lend or otherwise distribute the Software to any third party; (c) make the functionality of the Software available to multiple users through any means, including, but not limited to, by uploading the Software to a network or file-sharing service or through any hosting, application services provider, service bureau, software-as-a-service or any other type of services. You acknowledge and agree that portions of the Software, including, but not limited to, the source code and the specific design and structure of individual modules or programs, constitute or contain trade secrets of GoPro and its licensors. Accordingly, you agree not to reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or create any derivative work of the Software, in whole or part, or permit or authorize a third party to do so, except to the extent such activities are expressly permitted by law notwithstanding this prohibition.  <br><br>3.  DATA COLLECTION.  To facilitate product support, product development and improvement as well as other services to you and other GoPro customers, you agree that GoPro may collect certain information about your use of the Software as described in our Privacy Policy (available at http://gopro.com/privacy-policy). <br> <br>4.

UPGRADES.  If this copy of the Software is an upgrade from an earlier version of the Software, it is provided to you on a license exchange basis.

USE OF GOPRO EDIT TEMPLATES.  The Software contains sample audiovisual works incorporating video cuts and musical content (“GoPro Edit Templates”).  Subject to the terms of this EULA, you may use the GoPro Edit Templates, solely as specified in the Software, to create videos incorporating your own original video cuts and the supplied musical content (“User Videos”).  For User Videos that utilize musical content supplied by the Software, you may create, display and distribute your User Videos through social media sites and other Internet websites, for non-commercial purposes only.  You may not use, copy, display or distribute the GoPro Edit Templates or the included content in any other manner or for any other purpose, and GoPro and its licensors retain all copyrights and other proprietary rights in the GoPro Edit Templates and such content.  If you use the GoPro bumpers you must retain them without modification.  In addition, you may not use the GoPro Edit Templates to create, distribute or display any User Videos or other content that: (i) is defamatory, obscene or pornographic; (ii) promotes discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group; (iii) infringes, misappropriates or violates a third party’s intellectual property rights or rights of publicity or privacy; (iv) violates, or encourages any conduct that would violate, any applicable law or regulation; (vi) promotes violence or actions that are threatening to any person or entity; or (vi) promotes illegal activities or substances.

GOPRO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED FROM GOPRO OR ELSEWHERE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS EULA. <br> <br>10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT WILL GOPRO BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) OR FOR THE COST OR PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE OR GOPRO EDIT TEMPLATES, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT GOPRO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL GOPRO'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ANY PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES THE SOFTWARE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS EULA IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br> <br>11. INDEMNITY.  You shall indemnify and hold GoPro harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs and fees (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from (i) your use of the Software (including the GoPro Edit Templates), (ii) your failure to comply with any term of this EULA; and (iii) any claim that your Content infringes the intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights of a third party.<br> <br>12. TERM AND TERMINATION.  The license granted under this EULA shall continue in effect until terminated.  You may terminate this EULA at any time by destroying all copies of the Software in your possession or control.

Any termination of this EULA shall also terminate the licenses granted hereunder. Upon termination of this EULA for any reason, you shall promptly destroy and remove from all computers, hard drives, networks, and other storage media all copies of the Software in your possession or control and cease all use of the Software. You shall not be entitled to any refund as a result of any termination of this Agreement.  Sections 2, 4, 5, and 8 through 15, shall survive termination or expiration of this EULA.  <br><br>13. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

If the Software and Documentation are being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government, then, as provided in FAR 12.212 and DFARS 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the U.S. Government’s rights in the Software and Documentation will be only those specified in this EULA.<br><br>14.

MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement represents the complete understanding and agreement concerning the subject matter between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and communications, oral or written, between the parties, unless you and GoPro have executed a separate agreement. GoPro reserves the right to modify this EULA and will give you reasonable notice of any changes.  Your continued use of the Software after such notice will indicate your consent to any such changes. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the other provisions will remain in full force and effect. The failure by either party to enforce any provision of this EULA will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. You may not assign or transfer this EULA or any rights granted hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without GoPro’s prior written consent, and any attempt by you to do so, without such consent, will be void. GoPro expressly reserves the right to freely assign this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under California law, without regard to conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. The sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any legal action or proceeding arising under this EULA shall be the state and federal courts in San Mateo County, California, and the parties hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.<br><br>16.
