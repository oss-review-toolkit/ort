By contrast,</p><p>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to</p><p>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free</p><p>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the</p><p>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to</p><p>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to</p><p>your programs, too.</p><p>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</p><p>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</p><p>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</p><p>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</p><p>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</p><p>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p><p>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</p><p>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have</p><p>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if</p><p>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p><p>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</p><p>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</p><p>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive</p><p>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they</p><p>know their rights.</p><p>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</p><p>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</p><p>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p><p>  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains</p><p>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and</p><p>authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</p><p>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</p><p>authors of previous versions.</p><p>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</p><p>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer</p><p>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of</p><p>protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic</p><p>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</p><p>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we</p><p>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</p><p>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</p><p>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</p><p>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p><p>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</p><p>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</p><p>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to</p><p>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could</p><p>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that</p><p>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p><p>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</p><p>modification follow.</p><p>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p><p>  0. Definitions.</p><p>  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p><p>  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</p><p>works, such as semiconductor masks.</p><p>  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</p><p>License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and</p><p>\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.</p><p>  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</p><p>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</p><p>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the</p><p>earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.</p><p>  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based</p><p>on the Program.</p><p>  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without</p><p>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</p><p>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</p><p>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,</p><p>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</p><p>public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p><p>  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</p><p>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through</p><p>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p><p>  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"</p><p>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</p><p>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</p><p>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</p><p>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</p><p>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If</p><p>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</p><p>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p><p>  1. Source Code.</p><p>  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work</p><p>for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source</p><p>form of a work.</p><p>  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official</p><p>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</p><p>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</p><p>is widely used among developers working in that language.</p><p>  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other</p><p>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</p><p>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</p><p>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</p><p>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</p><p>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A</p><p>\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component</p><p>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</p><p>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</p><p>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p><p>  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all</p><p>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</p><p>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</p><p>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's</p><p>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</p><p>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</p><p>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source</p><p>includes interface definition files associated with source files for</p><p>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</p><p>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</p><p>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</p><p>subprograms and other parts of the work.</p><p>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</p><p>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</p><p>Source.</p><p>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</p><p>same work.</p><p>  2. Basic Permissions.</p><p>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</p><p>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</p><p>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</p><p>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a</p><p>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</p><p>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your</p><p>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p><p>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</p><p>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains</p><p>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose</p><p>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you</p><p>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with</p><p>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do</p><p>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works</p><p>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction</p><p>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of</p><p>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p><p>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under</p><p>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10</p><p>makes it unnecessary.</p><p>  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</p><p>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</p><p>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</p><p>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</p><p>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</p><p>measures.</p><p>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</p><p>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention</p><p>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</p><p>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or</p><p>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's</p><p>users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of</p><p>technological measures.</p><p>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</p><p>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you</p><p>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</p><p>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</p><p>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any</p><p>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</p><p>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</p><p>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p><p>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</p><p>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p><p>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</p><p>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</p><p>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</p><p>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p><p>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified</p><p>    it, and giving a relevant date.</p><p>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</p><p>    released under this License and any conditions added under section</p><p>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to</p><p>    \"keep intact all notices\".</p><p>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this</p><p>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This</p><p>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7</p><p>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,</p><p>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no</p><p>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</p><p>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</p><p>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</p><p>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</p><p>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your</p><p>    work need not make them do so.</p><p>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</p><p>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</p><p>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,</p><p>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an</p><p>\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not</p><p>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users</p><p>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work</p><p>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other</p><p>parts of the aggregate.</p><p>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</p><p>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</p><p>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</p><p>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</p><p>in one of these ways:</p><p>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</p><p>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</p><p>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</p><p>    customarily used for software interchange.</p><p>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</p><p>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</p><p>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</p><p>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</p><p>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</p><p>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</p><p>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</p><p>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</p><p>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</p><p>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</p><p>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</p><p>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</p><p>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This</p><p>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</p><p>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</p><p>    with subsection 6b.</p><p>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</p><p>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</p><p>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</p><p>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the</p><p>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to</p><p>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</p><p>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</p><p>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</p><p>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</p><p>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the</p><p>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</p><p>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</p><p>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</p><p>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</p><p>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</p><p>    charge under subsection 6d.</p><p>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</p><p>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</p><p>included in conveying the object code work.</p><p>  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any</p><p>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,</p><p>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation</p><p>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,</p><p>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular</p><p>product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a</p><p>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status</p><p>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</p><p>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product</p><p>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</p><p>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</p><p>the only significant mode of use of the product.</p><p>  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,</p><p>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install</p><p>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from</p><p>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must</p><p>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object</p><p>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</p><p>modification has been made.</p><p>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</p><p>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</p><p>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</p><p>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</p><p>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</p><p>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</p><p>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply</p><p>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</p><p>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has</p><p>been installed in ROM).</p><p>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</p><p>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates</p><p>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for</p><p>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a</p><p>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and</p><p>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and</p><p>protocols for communication across the network.</p><p>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</p><p>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly</p><p>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in</p><p>source code form), and must require no special password or key for</p><p>unpacking, reading or copying.</p><p>  7. Additional Terms.</p><p>  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this</p><p>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</p><p>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</p><p>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent</p><p>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions</p><p>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately</p><p>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by</p><p>this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p><p>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</p><p>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</p><p>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own</p><p>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place</p><p>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,</p><p>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p><p>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you</p><p>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of</p><p>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p><p>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</p><p>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</p><p>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or</p><p>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal</p><p>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</p><p>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or</p><p>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in</p><p>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</p><p>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or</p><p>    authors of the material; or</p><p>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some</p><p>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</p><p>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that</p><p>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of</p><p>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for</p><p>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on</p><p>    those licensors and authors.</p><p>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further</p><p>restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you</p><p>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is</p><p>governed by this License along with a term that is a further</p><p>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains</p><p>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this</p><p>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms</p><p>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does</p><p>not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p><p>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</p><p>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the</p><p>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating</p><p>where to find the applicable terms.</p><p>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</p><p>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;</p><p>the above requirements apply either way.</p><p>  8. Termination.</p><p>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</p><p>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</p><p>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</p><p>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</p><p>paragraph of section 11).</p><p>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</p><p>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</p><p>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</p><p>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright</p><p>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means</p><p>prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p><p>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</p><p>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</p><p>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</p><p>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</p><p>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</p><p>your receipt of the notice.</p><p>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</p><p>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</p><p>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</p><p>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</p><p>material under section 10.</p><p>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</p><p>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</p><p>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work</p><p>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</p><p>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,</p><p>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</p><p>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do</p><p>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</p><p>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p><p>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</p><p>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</p><p>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</p><p>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible</p><p>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p><p>  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an</p><p>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</p><p>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered</p><p>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</p><p>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</p><p>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could</p><p>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</p><p>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</p><p>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p><p>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</p><p>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may</p><p>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</p><p>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</p><p>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</p><p>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</p><p>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p><p>  11. Patents.</p><p>  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</p><p>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The</p><p>work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".</p><p>  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims</p><p>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</p><p>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</p><p>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</p><p>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</p><p>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For</p><p>purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant</p><p>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</p><p>this License.</p><p>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</p><p>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to</p><p>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</p><p>propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p><p>  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express</p><p>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</p><p>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</p><p>sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a</p><p>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</p><p>patent against the party.</p><p>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</p><p>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</p><p>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</p><p>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</p><p>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</p><p>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</p><p>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</p><p>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</p><p>license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have</p><p>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</p><p>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work</p><p>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</p><p>country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p><p>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</p><p>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</p><p>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</p><p>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</p><p>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</p><p>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</p><p>work and works based on it.</p><p>  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within</p><p>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</p><p>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</p><p>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered</p><p>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</p><p>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</p><p>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</p><p>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</p><p>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</p><p>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</p><p>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</p><p>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</p><p>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</p><p>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p><p>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</p><p>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</p><p>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p><p>  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</p><p>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</p><p>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</p><p>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a</p><p>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</p><p>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</p><p>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you</p><p>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey</p><p>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this</p><p>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p><p>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</p><p>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</p><p>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed</p><p>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single</p><p>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this</p><p>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</p><p>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,</p><p>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the</p><p>combination as such.</p><p>  14. Revised Versions of this License.</p><p>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</p><p>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</p><p>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</p><p>address new problems or concerns.</p><p>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the</p><p>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General</p><p>Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the</p><p>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered</p><p>version or of any later version published by the Free Software</p><p>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the</p><p>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published</p><p>by the Free Software Foundation.</p><p>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future</p><p>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's</p><p>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you</p><p>to choose that version for the Program.</p><p>  Later license versions may give you additional or different</p><p>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any</p><p>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a</p><p>later version.</p><p>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p><p>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY</p><p>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT</p><p>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY</p><p>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,</p><p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</p><p>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM</p><p>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF</p><p>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p><p>  16. Limitation of Liability.</p><p>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</p><p>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS</p><p>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY</p><p>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE</p><p>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF</p><p>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD</p><p>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),</p><p>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF</p><p>SUCH DAMAGES.</p><p>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</p><p>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided</p><p>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,</p><p>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates</p><p>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the</p><p>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a</p><p>copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p><p>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p><p>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p><p>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</p><p>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</p><p>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p><p>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</p><p>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</p><p>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</p><p>the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p><p>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</p><p>    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</p><p>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify</p><p>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by</p><p>    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or</p><p>    (at your option) any later version.</p><p>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</p><p>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</p><p>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the</p><p>    GNU General Public License for more details.</p><p>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License</p><p>    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.</p><p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p><p>  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short</p><p>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p><p>    &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</p><p>    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.</p><p>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it</p><p>    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.</p><p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate</p><p>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands</p><p>might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".</p><p>  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,</p><p>if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.</p><p>For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see</p><p>&lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.</p><p>  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program</p><p>into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you</p><p>may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with</p><p>the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General</p><p>Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read</p><p>&lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.</p>"
