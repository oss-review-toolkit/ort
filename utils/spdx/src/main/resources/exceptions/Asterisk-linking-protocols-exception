Specific permission is also granted to link Asterisk with OpenSSL, OpenH323
UniMRCP, and/or the UW IMAP Toolkit and distribute the resulting binary files.

In addition, Asterisk implements several management/control protocols.
This includes the Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI), the Asterisk Gateway
Interface (AGI), and the Asterisk REST Interface (ARI). It is our belief
that applications using these protocols to manage or control an Asterisk
instance do not have to be licensed under the GPL or a compatible license,
as we believe these protocols do not create a 'derivative work' as referred
to in the GPL. However, should any court or other judiciary body find that
these protocols do fall under the terms of the GPL, then we hereby grant you a
license to use these protocols in combination with Asterisk in external
applications licensed under any license you wish.
