OCaml LGPL Linking Exception

As a special exception to the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may link,
statically or dynamically, a "work that uses the OCaml Core System " with a
publicly distributed version of the OCaml Core System to produce an executable
file containing portions of the OCaml Core System , and distribute that
executable file under terms of your choice, without any of the additional
requirements listed in clause 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License. By
"a publicly distributed version of the OCaml Core System ", we mean either the
unmodified OCaml Core System as distributed by INRIA , or a modified version of
the OCaml Core System that is distributed under the conditions defined in clause
2 of the GNU Lesser General Public License. This exception does not however
invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU
Lesser General Public License.
