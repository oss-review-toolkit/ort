The Universal FOSS Exception, Version 1.0

In addition to the rights set forth in the other license(s) included in the
distribution for this software, data, and/or documentation (collectively the
"Software," and such licenses collectively with this additional permission the
"Software License"), the copyright holders wish to facilitate interoperability
with other software, data, and/or documentation distributed with complete
corresponding source under a license that is OSI-approved and/or categorized by
the FSF as free (collectively "Other FOSS"). We therefore hereby grant the
following additional permission with respect to the use and distribution of the
Software with Other FOSS, and the constants, function signatures, data
structures and other invocation methods used to run or interact with each of
them (as to each, such software's "Interfaces"):

   (i) The Software's Interfaces may, to the extent permitted by the license of
   the Other FOSS, be copied into, used and distributed in the Other FOSS in
   order to enable interoperability, without requiring a change to the license
   of the Other FOSS other than as to any Interfaces of the Software embedded
   therein. The Software's Interfaces remain at all times under the Software
   License, including without limitation as used in the Other FOSS (which upon
   any such use also then contains a portion of the Software under the Software
   License).

   (ii) The Other FOSS's Interfaces may, to the extent permitted by the license
   of the Other FOSS, be copied into, used and distributed in the Software in
   order to enable interoperability, without requiring that such Interfaces be
   licensed under the terms of the Software License or otherwise altering their
   original terms, if this does not require any portion of the Software other
   than such Interfaces to be licensed under the terms other than the Software
   License.

   (iii) If only Interfaces and no other code is copied between the Software and
   the Other FOSS in either direction, the use and/or distribution of the
   Software with the Other FOSS shall not be deemed to require that the Other
   FOSS be licensed under the license of the Software, other than as to any
   Interfaces of the Software copied into the Other FOSS. This includes, by way
   of example and without limitation, statically or dynamically linking the
   Software together with Other FOSS after enabling interoperability using the
   Interfaces of one or both, and distributing the resulting combination under
   different licenses for the respective portions thereof.

For avoidance of doubt, a license which is OSI-approved or categorized by the
FSF as free, includes, for the purpose of this permission, such licenses with
additional permissions, and any license that has previously been so-approved or
categorized as free, even if now deprecated or otherwise no longer recognized as
approved or free. Nothing in this additional permission grants any right to
distribute any portion of the Software on terms other than those of the Software
License or grants any additional permission of any kind for use or distribution
of the Software in conjunction with software other than Other FOSS.
