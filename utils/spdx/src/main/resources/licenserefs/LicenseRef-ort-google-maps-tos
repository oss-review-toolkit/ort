Google Maps Platform License Agreement

This Google Maps Platform License Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and
entered into between Google (as defined in Section 21 (Definitions)) and the entity or person
agreeing to these terms ("Customer").
This Agreement is effective as of the date Customer clicks to accept the Agreement, or
enters into a Reseller Agreement if purchasing through a Reseller (the "Effective Date").
If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that: (a) you have full
legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (b) you have read and understand this
Agreement; and (c) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement. If you do not have
the legal authority to bind Customer, please do not click to accept. This Agreement governs
Customer's access to and use of the Services.

1. Provision of the Services.
1.1 Use of the Services in Customer Applications.  Google will provide the Services to Customer in accordance with the Agreement, and Customer may use the Services in Customer Application(s) in accordance with Section 3 (License).
1.2 Admin Console; Projects; API Keys. Customer will administer the Services through the online Admin Console. To access the Services, Customer must create Project(s) and use its API key(s) in accordance with the Documentation.
1.3 Accounts. Customer must have an Account. Customer is responsible for: (a) the information it provides in connection with the Account; (b) maintaining the confidentiality and security of the Account and associated passwords; and (c) any use of its Account.
1.4 Customer Domains and Applications. Customer must list in the Admin Console each authorized domain and application that uses the Services. Customer is responsible for ensuring that only authorized domains and applications use the Services.
1.5 New Features and Services. Google may: (a) make new features or functionality available through the Services and (b) add new services to the "Services" definition (by adding them at the URL stated under that definition). Customer’s use of new features or functionality may be contingent on Customer’s agreement to additional terms applicable to the new feature or functionality.
1.6 Modifications.
1.6.1 To the Services. Subject to Section 9 (Deprecation Policy), Google may make changes to the Services, which may include adding, updating, or discontinuing any Services or portion or feature(s) of the Services. Google will notify Customer of any material change to the Services.
1.6.2. To the Agreement. Google may make changes to the Agreement, including pricing and any linked documents. Unless otherwise noted by Google, material changes to the Agreement will become effective 30 days after notice is given, except (a) materially adverse SLA changes will become effective 90 days after notice is given; and (b) changes applicable to new Services or functionality, or required by a court order or applicable law, will be effective immediately. Google will provide notice for materially adverse changes to any SLAs by: (i) sending an email to the Notification Email Address; (ii) posting a notice in the Admin Console; or (iii) posting a notice to the applicable SLA webpage. If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, Customer should stop using the Services. Google will post any modification to this Agreement to the Terms URL.

2. Payment Terms.
2.1 Free Quota. Certain Services are provided to Customer without charge up to the Fee Threshold, as applicable.
2.2 Online Billing. At the end of the applicable Fee Accrual Period, Google will issue an electronic bill to Customer for all charges accrued above the Fee Threshold based on Customer’s use of the Services during the previous Fee Accrual Period. For use above the Fee Threshold, Customer will be responsible for all Fees up to the amount set in the Account and will pay all Fees in the currency set forth in the invoice. If Customer elects to pay by credit card, debit card, or other non-invoiced form of payment, Google will charge (and Customer will pay) all Fees immediately at the end of the Fee Accrual Period. If Customer elects to pay by invoice (and Google agrees), all Fees are due as stated in the invoice. Customer’s obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable. Google's measurement of Customer’s use of the Services is final. Google has no obligation to provide multiple bills. Payments made via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by Google. If Customer has entered into the Agreement with GCL, Google may collect payments via Google Payment Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales with offices at Belgrave House, 76 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9TQ, United Kingdom.
2.3 Taxes.
2.3.1 Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer will pay Google for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If Google is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer, unless Customer provides Google with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. In some states the sales tax is due on the total purchase price at the time of sale and must be invoiced and collected at the time of the sale. If Customer is required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to Google, Customer must provide Google with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such withholding. If under the applicable tax legislation the Services are subject to local VAT and the Customer is required to make a withholding of local VAT from amounts payable to Google, the value of Services calculated in accordance with the above procedure will be increased (grossed up) by Customer for the respective amount of local VAT and the grossed up amount will be regarded as a VAT inclusive price. Local VAT amount withheld from the VAT-inclusive price will be remitted to the applicable local tax entity by the Customer and Customer will ensure that Google will receive payment for its services for the net amount as would otherwise be due (the VAT inclusive price less the local VAT withheld and remitted to applicable tax authority).
2.3.2 If required under applicable law, Customer will provide Google with applicable tax identification information that Google may require to ensure its compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. Customer will be liable to pay (or reimburse Google for) any taxes, interest, penalties or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by the Customer.
2.4 Invoice Disputes & Refunds. Any invoice disputes must be submitted before the payment due date. If Google determines that Fees were incorrectly invoiced, then Google will issue a credit equal to the agreed amount. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all claims relating to Fees unless claimed within 60 days after charged (this does not affect any Customer rights with its credit card issuer). Nothing in the Agreement obligates Google to extend credit to any party.
2.5 Delinquent Payments; Suspension. If Customer’s payment is overdue, then Google may (a) charge interest on overdue amounts at 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the Payment Due Date until paid in full, and (b) Suspend the Services or terminate the Agreement. Customer will reimburse Google for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by Google in collecting overdue payments except where such payments are due to Google’s billing inaccuracies.
2.6 No Purchase Order Number Required. Google is not required to provide a purchase order number on Google’s invoice (or otherwise).

3.1 License Grant. Subject to the Agreement's terms, during the Term, Google grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, license to use the Services in Customer Application(s).
3.2 License Requirements and Restrictions. The following are conditions of the license granted in Section 3.1 (License Grant). In this Section 3.2 (License Requirements and Restrictions), the phrase “Customer will not” means “Customer will not, and will not permit a third party to”.

(i) The Customer Application’s terms of service will (A) notify users that the Customer Application includes Google Maps features and content; and (B) state that use of Google Maps features and content is subject to the then-current versions of the: (1) Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service at https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html; and (2) Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.
(ii) If the Customer Application allows users to include the Google Maps Core Services in Downstream Products, then Customer will contractually require that all Downstream Products’ terms of service satisfy the same notice and flow-down requirements that apply to the Customer Application under Section 3.2.2 (a) (i) (Terms of Service and Privacy Policy).
(iii) If users of the Customer Application (and Downstream Products, if any) fail to comply with the applicable terms of the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service, then Customer will take appropriate enforcement action, including Suspending or terminating those users’ use of Google Maps features and content in the Customer Application or Downstream Products.

3.2.3 Restrictions Against Misusing the Services.

For example, Customer will not: (i) pre-fetch, index, store, reshare, or rehost Google Maps Content outside the services; (ii) bulk download Google Maps tiles, Street View images, geocodes, directions, distance matrix results, roads information, places information, elevation values, and time zone details; (iii) copy and save business names, addresses, or user reviews; or (iv) use Google Maps Content with text-to-speech services.
(b) No Caching. Customer will not cache Google Maps Content except as expressly permitted under the Maps Service Specific Terms.
(c) No Creating Content From Google Maps Content. Customer will not create content based on Google Maps Content.

(d) No Re-Creating Google Products or Features. Customer will not use the Services to create a product or service with features that are substantially similar to or that re-create the features of another Google product or service. Customer’s product or service must contain substantial, independent value and features beyond the Google products or services. For example, Customer will not: (i) re-distribute the Google Maps Core Services or pass them off as if they were Customer’s services; (ii) use the Google Maps Core Services to create a substitute of the Google Maps Core Services, Google Maps, or Google Maps mobile apps, or their features; (iii) use the Google Maps Core Services in a listings or directory service or to create or augment an advertising product; (iv) combine data from the Directions API, Geolocation API, and Maps SDK for Android to create real-time navigation functionality substantially similar to the functionality provided by the Google Maps for Android mobile app.
(e) No Use With Non-Google Maps. To avoid quality issues and/or brand confusion, Customer will not use the Google Maps Core Services with or near a non-Google Map in a Customer Application. For example, Customer will not (i) display or use Places content on a non-Google map, (ii) display Street View imagery and non-Google maps on the same screen, or (iii) link a Google Map to non-Google Maps content or a non-Google map.
(f) No Circumventing Fees. Customer will not circumvent the applicable Fees. For example, Customer will not create multiple billing accounts or Projects to avoid incurring Fees, prevent Google from accurately calculating Customer’s Service usage levels, abuse any free Service quotas, or offer access to the Services under a “time-sharing” or “service bureau” model.
(g) No Use in Prohibited Territories. Customer will not distribute or market in a Prohibited Territory any Customer Application(s) that use the Google Maps Core Services.
(h) No Use in Embedded Vehicle Systems. Customer will not use the Google Maps Core Services in connection with any Customer Application or device embedded in a vehicle. For example, Customer will not create a Customer Application that (i) is embedded in an in-dashboard automotive infotainment system; and (ii) allows End Users to request driving directions from the Directions API.
(i)  No Use in Customer Application Directed To Children. Customer will not use the Google Maps Core Services in a Customer Application that would be deemed to be a “Web site or online service directed to children” under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

3.2.4 Benchmarking. Customer may not publicly disclose directly or through a third party the results of any comparative or compatibility testing, benchmarking, or evaluation of the Services (each, a “Test”), unless the disclosure includes all information necessary for Google or a third party to replicate the Test. If Customer conducts, or directs a third party to conduct, a Test of the Services and publicly discloses the results directly or through a third party, then Google (or a Google directed third party) may conduct Tests of any publicly available cloud products or services provided by Customer and publicly disclose the results of any such Test (which disclosure will include all information necessary for Customer or a third party to replicate the Test).

Google will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and may terminate repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances as required to maintain safe harbor for online service providers under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If Customer believes a person or entity is infringing Customer’s or End Users’ copyrights and would like to notify Google, Customer can find information about submitting notices, and Google's policy about responding to notices at https://www.google.com/dmca.html.
