For purposes of this definition, "control" (including the terms "controlling," "controlled by" and "under common control with"), as used with respect to such party, shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of management or policies of such party through the majority ownership of voting securities. Any Affiliated Company shall not be deemed as third party in this ASLP.

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any party that has an AUTOSAR Development License that distributes or provides Contributions to the Program.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
Grant of Rights by Contributor to Recipient

a) Copyright License
Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Patent License
Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Licensing under the Terms of the Artop Software License Based on AUTOSAR Released Material (ASLR)
Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient the right to license the Program to third parties under the terms of the ASLR, provided that:
(i) the AUTOSAR Development Materials used in the Program have been officially released entirely or partially by the AUTOSAR development cooperation;
(ii) Recipient removes parts of the Program that have not been officially released by the AUTOSAR development cooperation as required by AUTOSAR regulations.

The AUTOSAR development cooperation is not obliged to use the entire set of AUTOSAR Development Materials for an official release. AUTOSAR Released Materials can be based on subsets of the AUTOSAR Development Materials.

d) Third Party Intellectual Property Rights
Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.

For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

e) Contributor Represents Sufficient Rights
Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the licenses set forth in this License.

3. NON-ASSERTION
Each Recipient agrees not to assert against any other Recipient exploiting Artop commercially regarding any intellectual property rights used by the Program.

Any beneficiary of this non-assertion may enforce it for its own benefit, provided that it grants similar non-assertion commitments to the Recipient or properly obligated successors in rights to the respective intellectual property.

4. REQUIREMENTS

8. GENERAL
8.1 Severability

8.2 Recipient Claims Intellectual Property Rights Infringements
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
8.3 Term
The term of this License shall expire as soon as:
a) the development work in AUTOSAR for the AUTOSAR Development Materials used in the Program is completed and the AUTOSAR Development Materials have been officially released entirely or partially by the AUTOSAR development cooperation; or

However, Recipient's obligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
8.5 Restrictions of Granted Rights
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this License, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this License are reserved.
