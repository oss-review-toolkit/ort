The Questions

Due to an inordinate amount of email I receive regarding development specific questions, I find it sometimes difficult to respond. If you don't hear from me, I recommend searching either Microsoft's MSDN Library Online, Microsoft's Online Support Knowledge Base, or Deja News newsgroup archives for answers to your Visual Basic related questions.

You may find me frequenting some of the "vb" newsgroups on the Microsoft news server msnews.microsoft.com, and on occasion, the "vb" newsgroups on the news server news.devx.com.
