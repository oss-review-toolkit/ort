You are free to use/modify this code but leave this header intact. This class is public domain so you are free to use it any of your applications (Freeware,Shareware,Commercial). All I ask is that you let me know so that if you have a real winner I can brag to my buddies that some of my code is in your app. I also wouldn't mind if you sent me a copy of your application since I like to play with new stuff.
