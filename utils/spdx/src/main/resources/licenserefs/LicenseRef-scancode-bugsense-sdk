Last Updated: September 25, 2013
YOU SHOULD READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY, AS IT CONSTITUTES A BINDING CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND BUGSENSE.

By downloading, installing, accessing, or otherwise copying or using all or any portion of the BugSense SDK, (i) you accept this SDK License Agreement ("Agreement") on behalf of the entity for which you are authorized to act (e.g., an employer) and acknowledge that such entity is legally bound by this Agreement or, if there is no such entity for which you are authorized to act, you accept this Agreement on behalf of yourself as an individual and acknowledge that you are legally bound by this Agreement, and (ii) you represent and warrant that you have the right, power and authority to act on behalf of and bind such entity (if any) and yourself. Also, to enter into this Agreement, and thereby use the BugSense SDK, you as an individual must be at least 18 years old. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old.

In this Agreement, "BugSense," "we," "us," and "our" refers to BugSense, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and "you" and "your" refer to the entity on whose behalf you are entering into this Agreement or, if there is no such entity, you as an individual.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, OR IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT, POWER AND AUTHORITY TO ACT ON BEHALF OF AND BIND SUCH ENTITY OR YOURSELF AS AN INDIVIDUAL (IF THERE IS NO SUCH ENTITY), DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, ACCESS OR OTHERWISE COPY OR USE ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE BUGSENSE SDK. THE BUGSENSE SDK IS BEING LICENSED AND NOT SOLD TO YOU. BUGSENSE PERMITS YOU TO DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, ACCESS, OR OTHERWISE COPY OR USE THE BUGSENSE SDK (INCLUDING THE FUNCTIONALITY OR FEATURES THEREOF) ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT.

1.	Definitions.
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in the text can be found in Exhibit A.

2.	Changes to Agreement.
We reserve the right to update or otherwise make changes to this Agreement from time to time on at least thirty (30) days’ notice, which notice we will provide to you by any reasonable means, including without limitation by posting the revised version of this Agreement on the website located at www.bugsense.com (or such other website as we may designate). If you object to the revised version of this Agreement, you will within such thirty (30) day period notify us of your objection and, if you so notify us, the revised version will not apply to you. Instead, effective at the end of such thirty (30) day period, your existing Agreement will terminate; you will cease all access to and use of the BugSense SDK; and we will have no obligation to further provide the BugSense SDK to you. If you do not notify us of your objection during the thirty (30) day period, your continued access to and use of the BugSense SDK after the effective date of such revised version of this Agreement will be deemed your acceptance of such revised version; however, changes to this Agreement will not apply to any dispute between you and us based on a claim filed before the effective date of the changes. You can determine when this Agreement was last revised by referring to the "LAST UPDATED" or similar legend at the top of this Agreement.

23.	Severability.
Unless otherwise provided herein, all rights and remedies, whether conferred hereunder or by any other instrument or law, will be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently.

The terms and conditions stated herein are declared to be severable. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect, and the provision affected will be construed so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible by law.

24.	Choice of Law and Disputes.
The following Choice of Law and Disputes terms and conditions will apply under this Agreement: This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, as if performed wholly within the state and without giving effect to the principles of conflict of law rules of any jurisdiction or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. (i) For other than the U.S. Government as a party, any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco, California and the parties hereby consent to personal jurisdiction and venue therein. If a dispute arises between you and BugSense, and either you or BugSense files suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce rights under this Agreement, then the prevailing party will be entitled to recover from the other party all costs of such action or suit, including but not limited to investigative costs, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees (including expenses incurred to collect those expenses). (ii) If a dispute arises between you and BugSense that is related to a government customer that is subject to the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. 601 et seq., concerning issues of fact or law which relate to this Agreement (a"CDA Dispute"), the following dispute procedures will apply. If the U.S. Government issues a final decision regarding a CDA Dispute, such decision will be provided within ten (10) days of receipt by you by written notification to BugSense and subsequently binding upon BugSense to the same extent it is binding upon you, subject to BugSense’s right to seek additional time, cost or both. BugSense will continue performance in accordance with the decision pending any appeal that may be initiated pursuant to the provisions below. If you elect to appeal such decision under your prime contract "Disputes" clause, BugSense will be permitted to participate fully in such appeal concerning issues of fact or law which relate to this Agreement for the purpose of protecting BugSense’s interest. You will not enter into a settlement with the government as to any portion of the appeal affecting BugSense without BugSense’s prior written consent. If you elect not to appeal a CDA Dispute, such election must be made within thirty (30) days of the government’s final decision and you agree to notify BugSense within three (3) days after you elect not to appeal. If BugSense elects to pursue appeal of such decision by the Contracting Officer, BugSense will provide written notice of such election to you, and the parties will enter into a sponsorship agreement pursuant to which BugSense will have the right to prosecute in your name any and all appeals arising from the government’s determination. Any such appeal brought by BugSense in your name will be at the expense of BugSense, provided, however, that you, at your expense, will provide BugSense with reasonable assistance in the presentation of such appeal. (iii) If you are the U.S. Government as a party to this Agreement, this Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613). Failure of the parties to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal, or action arising under or relating to this Agreement will be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at 48 C.F.R 52.233-1, which is incorporated in this Agreement by reference.

25.	General.
All notices required or permitted under this Agreement will be by email. All notices to BugSense will be sent to mobilesupport@splunk.com (or to such other email address as we may notice to you from time to time).
