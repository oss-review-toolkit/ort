*** CGIC Nonexclusive Commercial License

The licensee named below is granted the right to utilize CGIC, major version 1
or 2, any minor version thereof, in CGI applications without the need for a
credit notice of any kind. CGI applications developed by the holder of this
license may be distributed freely in source code or binary form without
additional fees or royalties. This license does not grant the right to use CGIC
to create a development tool which passes on substantially all of the
capabilities of the CGIC library to the user of the tool, unless that tool is to
be used internally by the license holder only in order to develop CGI
applications. This license may not be resold, but applications developed in
accordance with the terms of the license may be distributed freely subject to
the limitations described above.

Future minor (2.x) versions of CGIC will be covered by this license free of
charge. If significant defects of workmanship are discovered in version 2.x,
minor releases to correct them will be made available before or at the same time
that those defects are addressed in any future major version. Future "major"
(3.x) versions will be available to licensees at an upgrade price of $50.

If, for any reason, any portion of this license is found to be invalid, that
portion of the license only is invalidated and the remainder of the agreement
remains in effect.

If this license has not been signed by Thomas Boutell or M. L. Grant on behalf
of Boutell. Com, Inc., it is invalid.
