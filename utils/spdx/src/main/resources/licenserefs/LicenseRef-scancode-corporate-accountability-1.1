The +CAL Software License Agreement  (the "Agreement") (Version 1.1)

By exercising any of the rights licensed below, you (whether an individual or legal entity, the "Licensee") accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensee is granted the licensed rights set forth in Section 1 from the party listed above in the legal notice (whether an individual or legal entity, the "Licensor") in consideration of Licensee's acceptance of these terms and conditions, and Licensor grants Licensee such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the software and associated documentation files (the "Software") available under these terms and conditions. Licensor shall notify Corporate Accountability Lab ("CAL") of use of this Agreement by completing the form on the website at https://www.legaldesign.org/cal-software-license. Additional obligations apply only to use of the Software for Commercial Purpose, as stated in Sections 2(b) and 6(a). "Commercial Purpose" means any use of the Software other than for individual, personal, and non-business use and Commercial Purpose includes, without limitation, the (i) internal use of the Software (including Modified Software) for business purposes or (ii) Sharing (defined below) of the Software (including Modified Software) -- alone, in combination with, or embedded in other products or services that are made available to third parties -- for a fee or other consideration, or directly or indirectly in connection with any business.

For consideration Licensee and Licensor agree is satisfactory:

Section 1. License.

(a) Permission is hereby granted by Licensor, on a non-exclusive basis and free of charge to Licensee obtaining a copy of this Software, to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, embed in other products, sell copies of, or otherwise Share (defined below) the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do all of the above, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein is intended to nor shall be interpreted to interfere with any "fair use" rights available under copyright law nor grant any rights that are not protected by copyright law.

(b) Each time Licensee distributes, publishes, or otherwise makes the Software (or any component thereof) available to another person  or entity in any manner (including embedded in another product) ("Share" or "Sharing"), the Licensee's recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, including Licensor, subject to this Agreement, and the recipient then becomes a Licensee that must comply with  the terms of this Agreement.

(c) If Licensee creates a modified version of the Software (including any derivative work thereof) ("Modified Software"), Licensee may in turn Share the Modified Software; provided, however, that Licensee must apply this Agreement (or a later version) to any Sharing of the Modified Software as further described in Section 2, in which event Licensee would become a licensor and its recipient(s) would become licensee(s) with respect to the Modified Software.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, Licensor may also offer the Software (but not Modified Software) under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Software at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Agreement to Licensee nor Licensee's obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2. License Conditions. The grant of rights stated in Section 1 is expressly made subject to ongoing compliance with the following conditions and restrictions (the "Conditions") which are hereby accepted and agreed to by Licensee as obligations:

(a) Notice and Registration. The above legal notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software (including Modified Software) in both the code (e.g., in comments included in the source and object code) and human readable form (e.g., in a "readme" file or credits screen). Corporate Accountability Lab requests, though does not require, that Licensee register its use of the Software (including Modified Software) with CAL by completing the form on the website at https://www.legaldesign.org/cal-software-license. For the avoidance of doubt, failure to register use shall not relieve Licensee from its obligations to comply with the Conditions of the Agreement.

(b) Morals Clause for Safe and Environmentally Sustainable Supply Chains. If Licensee is a commercial entity, Licensee accepts a duty of care, as that term is used in tort law, delict law, and/or similar bodies of law closely related to tort and/or delict law, including without limitation, a requirement to act with the watchfulness, attention, caution, and prudence that a reasonable person in the circumstances would use ("Duty of Care") towards any person directly impacted by any supply chain utilizing the Software for Commercial Purposes (e.g., any person working in, or residing in proximity to, any supply chain activities, or person harmed in the production of Licensee's goods or provision of Licensee's services) and towards the environment directly impacted by any supply chain utilizing the Software for Commercial Purposes (e.g., any natural resources used in the production or manufacturing of Licensee's goods or provision of Licensee's services, or environment harmed by the disposal or removal of any by-products created during the production or manufacturing of Licensee's goods or provision of Licensee's services). If Licensee, its subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, or suppliers should, during the term of this Agreement,

    engage in any negligent conduct with respect to any person directly impacted by any supply chain  utilizing the Software for Commercial Purposes (e.g., violate any applicable labor law, fail to uphold a Duty of Care towards any worker or impacted person, fail to uphold a Licensee's own corporate-social responsibility commitments), or

    engage in any negligent conduct with respect to the environment directly impacted by any supply chain utilizing the Software for Commercial Purposes (e.g., violate any applicable environmental law, fail to conduct environmental impact assessments of supply chain activities or otherwise fail to uphold a Duty of Care towards the environment, fail to uphold Licensee's own environmental commitments),

Licensor and any Third-Party Beneficiary, and only Licensor and any Third-Party Beneficiary, will have the right to terminate this Agreement for cause. This shall not be interpreted to include acts committed by individuals outside the scope of their employment. If the Agreement is terminated pursuant to this clause, Licensor, and any Third-Party Beneficiary will each have an independent right to seek appropriate remedies at law or equity.
