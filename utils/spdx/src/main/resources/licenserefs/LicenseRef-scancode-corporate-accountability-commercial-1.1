The CC+CAL Commercial Use License Agreement Legal Notice

The CC+CAL Commercial Use License Agreement (the "Agreement") is intended to be used in tandem with any standard Creative Commons Public License that does not provide the public with rights to use licensed material for commercial purposes (i.e., a Creative Commons Public License that includes a NonCommercial restriction). Through this Agreement, licensors using a Creative Commons Public License grant additional permissions to the public to use the licensed material for commercial purposes subject to a Morals Clause for Safe and Environmentally Sustainable Supply Chains set forth in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement does not modify or customize any Creative Commons Public License. This Agreement is a separate and independent agreement intended to exist alongside a Creative Commons Public License, granting additional permissions not provided by the Creative Commons Public License that pertain specifically to the commercial use of licensed material and the use of licensed material to promote safe and environmentally sustainable supply chains.

The CC+CAL Commercial Use License Agreement is published by the Corporate Accountability Lab NFP ("CAL"). CAL is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Chicago, IL that designs legal solutions to protect people and the environment from corporate abuse. Through this Agreement, CAL seeks to empower producers of intellectual property to keep their intellectual property out of unethical supply chains and to support ethical and environmentally sustainable commercial use of intellectual property. CAL is not affiliated with Creative Commons and makes no representations as to Creative Commons' opinion of this Agreement or of CAL.

Section 2 - Scope

    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for Commercial purposes only; and

B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for Commercial purposes only.

4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.

The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Agreement, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.

5. Downstream recipients.

A. Offer from the Licensor - Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Agreement constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor, others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(b)(1)(A)(i), or Corporate Accountability Lab.

b. Other rights.

    Aside from any moral rights that are exercised by Licensor by including the Morals Clause for Safe and Environmentally Sustainable Supply Chains in Section 3(a), moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Agreement, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

    Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Agreement.

    To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used for Commercial purposes after Your rights under this Agreement have been terminated pursuant to Section 6(a).

3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(b)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Agreement.

Section 4 - Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for Commercial purposes, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(b) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Agreement where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 - Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Agreement or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 - Term and Termination.

a. This Agreement applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You, Your subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, or suppliers should, during the term of this Agreement,

    engage in any negligent conduct or conduct in violation of Section 3.a. of this agreement, with respect to any person directly impacted by any supply chain utilizing the Licensed Material for Commercial purposes (e.g., violate any applicable labor law, fail to uphold a Duty of Care towards any worker or impacted person, fail to uphold Your own corporate-social responsibility commitments), or

Your rights under this Agreement terminate automatically. For the avoidance of doubt, termination pursuant to this Section 6(a) shall not be triggered by any negligent conduct committed by individuals acting outside the scope of their employment for You, Your subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, or suppliers.

    automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
