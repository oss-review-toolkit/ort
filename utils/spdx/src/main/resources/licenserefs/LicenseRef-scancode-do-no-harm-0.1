TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

1. Preamble

Most software today is developed with little to no thought of how it will be used, or the
consequences for our society and planet.

As software developers, we engineer the infrastructure of the 21st century. We recognise that our
infrastructure has great power to shape the world and the lives of those we share it with, and we
choose to consciously take responsibility for the social and environmental impacts of what we build.

We envisage a world free from injustice, inequality, and the reckless destruction of lives and our
planet. We reject slavery in all its forms, whether by force, indebtedness, or by algorithms that
hack human vulnerabilities. We seek a world where humankind is at peace with our neighbours, nature,
and ourselves. We want our work to enrich the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of all
society.

We build software to further this vision of a just world, or at the very least, to not put that
vision further from reach.
