4. Users agree not to remove/ edit the credit notice within the DHTML source
code, or claim the code to be work of their own. What is the copyright notice?

instances, the credit notice must still be retained within the SCRIPT tags, in
the page's visible source:

<script src="countdown.js" type="text/javascript">
/***********************************************
* Dynamic Countdown script- © Dynamic Drive (http://www.dynamicdrive.com)
* This notice MUST stay intact for legal use
