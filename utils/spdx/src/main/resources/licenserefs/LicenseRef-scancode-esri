THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

ARTICLE 9—GENERAL PROVISIONS

9.1 Future Updates. Use of Products licensed under this License Agreement is covered by the terms and conditions contained herein. New or updated Products may require additional or revised terms of use under the then-current Esri License Agreement. Esri will make new or revised terms of use available at http://www.esri.com/legal/software-license or provide notice of new or revised terms to Licensee.

9.2 Export Control Regulations. Licensee expressly acknowledges and agrees that Licensee shall not export, reexport, import, transfer, release, or provide access to Products, Content, Licensee's Content, or Value-Added Applications to (i) any US embargoed country; (ii) any person on the US Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals; (iii) any person or entity on the US Commerce Department's Denied Persons List, Entity List, or Unverified List; or (iv) any person or entity or into any country where such export, reexport, access, or import violates any US, local, or other applicable import/export control laws or regulations including, but not limited to, the terms of any import/export license or license exemption and any amendments and supplemental additions to those import/export laws as they may occur from time to time.

9.3 Taxes and Fees, Shipping Charges. License fees quoted to Licensee are exclusive of any and all applicable taxes or fees, including, but not limited to, sales tax, use tax, value-added tax (VAT), customs, duties, or tariffs, and shipping and handling charges.

9.4 No Implied Waivers. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this License Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of the provisions or of the right of such party thereafter to enforce that or any other provision.

9.5 Severability. The parties agree that if any provision of this License Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make the intent of the language enforceable.

9.6 Successor and Assigns. Licensee shall not assign, sublicense, or transfer Licensee's rights or delegate Licensee's obligations under this License Agreement without Esri's and its authorized distributor's prior written consent, and any attempt to do so without consent shall be void. This License Agreement shall be binding on the respective successors and assigns of the parties to this License Agreement. Notwithstanding, a government contractor under contract to the government to deliver Products may assign this License Agreement and Products acquired for delivery to its government customer upon written notice to Esri, provided the government customer assents to the terms of this License Agreement.

9.7 Survival of Terms. The provisions of Articles 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of this License Agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of this License Agreement.

9.8 Equitable Relief.

If Licensee is a US government entity or US government contractor, Esri licenses Products to Licensee in accordance with this License Agreement under FAR Subparts 12.211/12.212 or DFARS Subpart 227.7202. Esri Data and Online Services are licensed under the same DFARS Subpart 227.7202 policy as commercial computer software for acquisitions made under DFARS.

License provisions that are inconsistent with federal law will not apply. A US government Licensee may transfer Software to any of its facilities to which it transfers the computer(s) on which such Software is installed. If any court, arbitrator, or board holds that Licensee has greater rights to any portion of Products under applicable public procurement law, such rights shall extend only to the portions affected.

Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction. If Licensee is a US government agency, this License Agreement is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 USC 601–613), in lieu of the arbitration provisions of this clause. This License Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.

9.13 Patents. Licensee may not seek, and may not permit any other user to seek, a patent or similar right worldwide that is based on or incorporates any Esri technology or services. This express prohibition on patenting shall not apply to Licensee's software and technology except to the extent that Esri technology or services, or any portion thereof, are a part of any claim or preferred embodiment in a patent application or a similar application.

9.14 Entire Agreement. This License Agreement, including its incorporated documents, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the parties as to the subject matter set forth herein and supersedes any previous license agreements, understandings, and arrangements between the parties relating to such subject matter.

ARTICLE 4—LICENSEE'S CONTENT, FEEDBACK

4.1 Licensee's Content. Licensee retains all right, title, and interest in Licensee's Content. Licensee hereby grants Esri and Esri's licensors a nonexclusive, nontransferable, worldwide right to host, run, and reproduce Licensee's Content solely for the purpose of enabling Licensee's use of Online Services. Without Licensee's permission, Esri will not access, use, or disclose Licensee's Content except as reasonably necessary to support Licensee's use of Online Services, respond to Licensee's requests for customer support, or troubleshoot Licensee's account or for any other purpose authorized by Licensee in writing. If Licensee accesses Online Services with an application provided by a third party, Esri may disclose Licensee's Content to such third party as necessary to enable interoperation between the application, Online Services, and Licensee's Content. Esri may disclose Licensee's Content if required to do so by law or pursuant to the order of a court or other government body, in which case Esri will reasonably attempt to limit the scope of disclosure. It is Licensee's sole responsibility to ensure that Licensee's Content is suitable for use with Online Services and for maintaining regular offline backups using the Online Services export and download capabilities.

4.2 Removal of Licensee's Content. Licensee will provide information and/or other materials related to Licensee's Content as reasonably requested by Esri to verify Licensee's compliance with this License Agreement. Esri may remove or delete any portions of Licensee's Content if there is reason to believe that uploading it to, or using it with, Online Services violates this License Agreement. If reasonable under these circumstances, Esri will notify Licensee before Licensee's Content is removed. Esri will respond to any Digital Millennium Copyright Act take-down notices in accordance with Esri's Copyright Policy, available at http://www.esri.com/legal/dmca_policy.

4.3 Sharing Licensee's Content. If Licensee elects to share Licensee's Content using Sharing Tools, then Licensee acknowledges that it has enabled third parties to use, store, cache, copy, reproduce, (re)distribute, and (re)transmit Licensee's Content through Online Services. ESRI IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS, DELETION, MODIFICATION, OR DISCLOSURE OF LICENSEE'S CONTENT RESULTING FROM USE OR MISUSE OF SHARING TOOLS OR ANY OTHER SERVICE COMPONENTS. LICENSEE'S USE OF SHARING TOOLS IS AT LICENSEE'S SOLE RISK.

4.4 Retrieving Licensee's Content upon Termination. Upon termination of the License Agreement or any trial, evaluation, or subscription, Esri will make Licensee's Content available to Licensee for download for a period of thirty (30) days unless Licensee requests a shorter window of availability or Esri is legally prohibited from doing so. Thereafter, Licensee's right to access or use Licensee's Content with Online Services will end, and Esri will have no further obligations to store or return Licensee's Content.

ARTICLE 5—LIMITS ON USE OF ONLINE SERVICES; SERVICE CREDITS

Esri may establish limits on the Online Services available to Licensee. These limits may be controlled through Service Credits. Service Credits are used to measure the consumption of ArcGIS Online services made available through Licensee's account. The maximum Service Credits provided with Licensee's ArcGIS Online account will be addressed in the applicable Ordering Document. Esri will notify Licensee's account administrator when Licensee's Service Credit consumption reaches approximately seventy-five percent (75%) of the Service Credits allocated to Licensee through Licensee's subscription. Esri will notify Licensee's account administrator if Licensee's Service Credit consumption reaches or exceeds one hundred percent (100%). If Licensee's account exceeds one hundred percent (100%) of the available Service Credits, Licensee may continue to access its account; however, Licensee's access to services that consume Service Credits will be suspended. Licensee's access to the services that consume Service Credits will be restored immediately upon the completion of Licensee's purchase of additional Service Credits.
