12. Compliance with Licenses. Adobe may, at its expense, and no more than once every twelve (12) months, appoint its own personnel or an independent third party to verify the number of copies and installations as well as usage of the Adobe software in use by Licensee. Any such verification shall be conducted upon seven (7) business days notice, during regular business hours at Licensee’s offices and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee’s business activities. Both Adobe and its auditors shall execute a commercially reasonable non-disclosure agreement with Licensee before proceeding with the verification. If such verification shows that Licensee is using a greater number of copies of the Software than that legitimately licensed, or are deploying or using the Software in any way not permitted under this Agreement and which would require additional license fees, Licensee shall pay the applicable fees for such additional copies within thirty (30) days of invoice date, with such underpaid fees being the license fees as per Adobe’s then-current, country specific, license fee list. If underpaid fees are in excess of five percent (5%) of the value of the fees paid under this Agreement, then Licensee shall pay such underpaid fees and Adobe’s reasonable costs of conducting the verification.

14.1 Limited Warranty for Users Residing in Germany or Austria.

If the functionalities of the Software vary substantially from the agreed upon functionalities, Adobe is entitled -- by way of re-performance and at its own discretion -- to repair or replace the Software. If this fails, Licensee is entitled to a reduction of the purchase price (reduction) or to cancel the purchase agreement (rescission). For further warranty information, please contact the Adobe Customer Support Department.

14.2 Limitation of Liability for Users Residing in Germany and Austria.

14.2.2 The aforesaid limitation of liability will not apply to any mandatory statutory liability, in particular, to liability under the German Product Liability Act, liability for assuming a specific guarantee or liability for culpably caused personal injuries.
