The Flowplayer Free version is released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3 (GPL). Our GPL based license requires that you do not remove the
copyright notices or author attribution from the player's user interface. These
are present in the player canvas (bottom left corner) and in the context menu.
See license FAQ for more details.

Commercial licenses are available. The commercial player version does not
require any Flowplayer notices or texts and also provides some additional
features.

Except as expressly provided herein, no trademark rights are granted in any
trademarks of Flowplayer, Ltd. Licensees are granted a limited, non-exclusive

new name that is not confusingly similar to Flowplayer and may not distribute it
under the name Flowplayer.
