3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

3.1 Application of License.

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section
2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Software may be distributed
only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License
released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License
with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.

3.2 Availability of Source Code.

Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on
the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
version of that particular Modification has been made available to
such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism
is maintained by a third party.

3.3 Description of Modifications.

You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain
a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software
and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
Software provided by Health Administration Corporation and including
the name of Health Administration Corporation in (a) the Source Code,
and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Software.

3.4 Intellectual Property Matters

a) Third Party Claims.

   If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
   intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
   granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
   must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
   "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim
   in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
   Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
   available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
   modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
   thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
   mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those
   who received the Covered Software that new knowledge has been obtained.

b) Contributor APIs.

   If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
   interface (API) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses
   which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor
   must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

c) Representations.

   Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
   3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
   Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
   rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5 Required Notices.

You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to
look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You
may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit
A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the
Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights
relating to Covered Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your
own behalf, and not on behalf of Health Administration Corporation or any
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
and You hereby agree to indemnify Health Administration Corporation and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by Health Administration
Corporation or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the
requirements of Sections 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software,
and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
Covered Software is available under the terms of this License, including
a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in
an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Software. You may
distribute the Executable version of Covered Software or ownership rights
under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,
not by Health Administration Corporation or any Contributor. You hereby
agree to indemnify Health Administration Corporation and every Contributor
for any liability incurred by Health Administration Corporation or such
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.7 Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other
software not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the
terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included
in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
distributions of the Source Code.  Except to the extent prohibited by
statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.

This License applies to code to which Health Administration Corporation
has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Software.

6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.

6.1 New Versions.

Health Administration Corporation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given
a distinguishing version number.

6.2 Effect of New Versions.

Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version
of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Software under
the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Health
Administration Corporation. No one other than Health Administration
Corporation has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered
Software created under this License.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
(NOT HEALTH ADMINISTRATION CORPORATION, ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES OR
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER
EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
sublicenses to the Covered Software which are properly granted shall
survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
shall survive.

8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Health Administration
Corporation or a Contributor (Health Administration Corporation
or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
"Participant") alleging that:

a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
   infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
   Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
   shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
   unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
   agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
   royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
   Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
   the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days
   of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
   mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation
   claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to
   You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the
   expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
   Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
   then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections
   2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first
   made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by
   that Participant.

8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

9.1 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, HEALTH
ADMINISTRATION CORPORATION, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR
OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS
OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT MAY ALLOW
LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH CASES, A PARTY'S, ITS EMPLOYEES',
LICENSORS' OR AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO AUD$100. NOTHING
CONTAINED IN THIS LICENSE SHALL PREJUDICE THE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF ANY
PARTY DEALING AS A CONSUMER.

9.2 Notwithstanding any other clause in the licence, and to the extent
permitted by law:

(a) Health Administration Corporation ("the Corporation") excludes all
    conditions and warranties which would otherwise be implied into
    a supply of goods or services arising out of or in relation to
    the granting of this licence by the Corporation or any associated
    acquisition of software to which this licence relates;

(b) Where a condition or warranty is implied into such a supply and
    that condition or warranty cannot be excluded by law that warranty
    or condition is implied into that supply and the liability of the
    Health Administration Corporation for a breach of that condition or
    warranty is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law and, in
    respect of conditions and warranties implied by the Trade Practices
    Act (Commonwealth of Australia) 1974, is limited, to the extent
    permitted by law, to one or more of the following at the election
    of the Corporation:

    (A) In the case of goods: (i) the replacement of the goods or the

APPENDIX 1. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HACOS LICENSE VERSION 1.2, THE
MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE VERSION 1.1 AND THE NOKIA OPEN SOURCE LICENSE
(NOKOS LICENSE) VERSION 1.0A

The HACOS License Version 1.2 was derived from the Mozilla Public
License Version 1.1 using some of the changes to the Mozilla Public
License embodied in the Nokia Open Source License (NOKOS License)
Version 1.0a. The differences between the HACOS License Version 1.2
(this document), the Mozilla Public License and the NOKOS License are
as follows:

i.    The title of the license was changed to "Health Administration
      Corporation Open Source License Version 1.2".

ii.   Globally, all references to "Netscape Communications Corporation",
      "Mozilla", "Nokia" and "Nokia Corporation" were changed to "Health
      Administration Corporation".

iii.  Globally, the words "means", "Covered Code" and "Covered Software"
      as used in the Mozilla Public License were changed to "shall means",
      "Covered Code" and "Covered Software" respectively, as used in
      the NOKOS License.

iv.   In Section 1 (Definitions), a definition of "Health Administration
      Corporation" was added.

v.    In Section 2, the term "intellectual property rights" used in the
      Mozilla Public License was replaced by the term "copyrights"
      as used in the NOKOS License.

vi.   In Section 2.2 (Contributor Grant), the words "Subject to the
      terms of this License" which appear in the NOKOS License were
      added to the Mozilla Public License.

vii.  The sentence "However, You may include an additional document
      offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5." which
      appears in the Mozilla Public License was omitted.

viii. Section 6.3 (Derivative Works) of the Mozilla Public License,
      which permits modifications to the Mozilla Public License,
      was omitted.

ix.   The original Section 9 (Limitation of Liability) was renumbered
      as Section 9.1, a maximum liability of AUD$100 was specified
      for those jurisdictions which do not allow complete exclusion of
      liability but which do allow limitation of liability. The sentence
      "NOTHING CONTAINED IN THE LICENSE SHALL PREJUDICE THE STATUTORY
      RIGHTS OF ANY PARTY DEALING AS A CONSUMER.", which appears in the
      NOKOS License but not in the Mozilla Public License, was added.

x.    Section 9.2 was added in order to further limit liability to the
      maximum extent permitted by the Commonwealth of Australia Trade
      Practices Act 1974.

xi.   Section 10 of the Mozilla Public License, which provides additional
      conditions for United States Government End Users, was omitted.

xii.  The governing law and jurisdiction for the settlement of disputes
      in Section 11 of the Mozilla Public License and Section 10 of the
      NOKOS License was changed to the laws of the State of New South
      Wales and the Supreme Court of New South Wales respectively. The
      exclusion of the application of the United Nations Convention on
      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods which appears in
      the Mozilla Public License was omitted.

xiii. Section 13 (Multiple-Licensed Code) of the Mozilla Public License
      was omitted.

xiv.  The provisions for alternative licensing arrangement for contributed
      code which appear in Exhibit A of the Mozilla Public License
      were omitted.
