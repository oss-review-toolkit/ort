1.   GRANT OF LICENSE.   This Section of the EULA describes Your general rights to install and use the Software Product. The license rights described in this Section are subject to all other terms and conditions of this EULA.

General License Grant to Install and Use Software Product.  You may install and use one copy of the Software Product on a single computer, device, workstation, terminal, or other digital electronic device ("Device"). You may make a second copy of the Software Product and install it on a portable Device for the exclusive use of the person who is the primary user of the first copy of the Software Product.

Alternative License Grant for Storage/Network Use.  As an alternative to the rights granted in the previous section, You may install a copy of the Software Product on one storage Device, such as a network server, and allow individuals within Your business or enterprise to access and use the Software Product from other Devices over a private network, provided that You acquire and dedicate a license for the storage Device upon which the Software Product is installed and each separate Device from which the Software Product is accessed and used.  A license for the Software Product may not be used concurrently on different Devices unless expressly permitted by this EULA.

Site License.  For the purposes of this EULA, a "site"¬ù is a computer network in a single physical location. If the Software Product is licensed with site license terms specified in the applicable price list or product packaging for the Software Product, you may make, use and install as many additional copies of the Software Product on the number of Client Devices as the site license authorizes.  You must have a reasonable mechanism in place to ensure that the number of Client Devices on which the Software Product has been installed does not exceed the number of licenses you have obtained.  This license authorizes you to make or download one copy of the Documentation for each additional copy authorized by the volume license, provided that each such copy contains all of the Documentation's proprietary notices.

Reservation of Rights.  All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Helios.

2.   DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.
Copy Protection.  The Software Product may include copy protection technology to prevent the unauthorized copying of the Software Product or may require original media for use of the Software Product on the Device.  It is illegal to make unauthorized copies of the Software Product or to circumvent any copy protection technology included in the Software Product.
Limitations on Reverse Engineering, Decompilation, and Disassembly.  You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software Product, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.

Separation of Component Parts. The Software Product is licensed as a single product. Its component parts may not be separated for use on more than one Device unless expressly permitted by this EULA.
Samples.  The Software Product may be provided with certain "Samples" intended to demonstrate use of the Software Product or provide a base starting point for use of the Software Product.  Samples include macros, clip libraries, syntax definition files, or similar items.  If Samples are provided, they are considered part of the Software Product for purposes of this EULA. However, you may use and create derivative works from Samples, provided that you do so in conjunction with your use of the Software Product, and that you maintain any copyright notices that may be incorporated within the Samples.

Trademarks.  This EULA does not grant You any rights in connection with any trade marks of Helios.

Term.  If the Software Product that was distributed to you was labeled as an EVALUATION VERSION or TRY & BUY VERSION (or its functional equivalent) (an "Evaluation Version"), the license granted under this EULA commences upon the installation of the Software Product and is effective for 30 days following the date you install the Software Product (the "Evaluation Term").  Evaluation Version Software Products may include software code intended to disable their functionality after the expiration of the Evaluation Term. You may take no actions to circumvent the operation of such disabling code, and you accept all risks that might arise from such disabling code.  If the Software Product was not distributed as an Evaluation Version, or if you converted an Evaluation Version installation of the Software Product to a non-Evaluation Version of the Software Product by authorised use of the conversion mechanism provided with the Software Product (in each case either being or resulting in a "Full-License Version"), the licenses granted under this EULA commence upon the installation of the Software Product and are effective in perpetuity unless terminated per the terms of this Agreement.

Software Transfer.  You may permanently transfer all of your rights under this EULA (except if your rights are in an Evaluation Version), provided you retain no copies, you transfer all copies of the Software Product (including all component parts, the media and printed materials, any prior versions, and this EULA), and the recipient agrees to be subject to the terms of this EULA.  Upon the occurrence of such a transfer, your rights under this EULA terminate immediately.

Termination.  Upon the expiration of the Evaluation Term (if any), your rights under this EULA terminate automatically without notice.  Without prejudice to any other rights, Helios may terminate this EULA if You fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this EULA.  In such event, You must destroy all copies of the Software Product and all of its component parts. The terms of this paragraph shall survive any termination of this EULA.

3.   UPGRADES.
If the Software Product is labeled as an upgrade, You must be properly licensed to use a product identified by Helios as being eligible for the upgrade in order to use the Software Product.  A Software Product labeled as an upgrade replaces or supplements (and may disable) the product that formed the basis for Your eligibility for the upgrade. You may use the resulting upgraded product only in accordance with the terms of this EULA.  If the Software Product is an upgrade of a component of a package of software programs that You licensed as a single product, the Software Product may be used and transferred only as part of that single product package and may not be separated for use on more than one Device.

The terms of Section 11 below ("Exclusion of Incidental, Consequential and Certain Other Damages") are also incorporated into this Limited Warranty.
