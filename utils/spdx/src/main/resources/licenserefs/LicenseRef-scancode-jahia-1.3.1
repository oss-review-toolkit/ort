      to use, reproduce, modify, display and distribute Your Error Corrections,
      Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications, in any form,
      including the right to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of

      Specifications.

      2.4. Subcontracting Error Corrections or Shared Modifications. You may
      deliver the Source Code of Community Code to other Licensees having at
      least a Research and Development Use license, for the purpose of
      furnishing development services to You in connection with Your rights
      granted in this License. All such Licensees must execute appropriate
      documents with respect to such work consistent with the terms of this
      License, and acknowledging their work-made-for-hire status or assigning
      exclusive right to the work product and associated Intellectual Property
      Rights to You.

      3. Requirements and Responsibilities.

      3.1. Research and Development Use License. As a condition of exercising
      the rights granted under Section 2.1 a) above, You agree to comply with
      the following:

      a) Your Contribution to the Community. All Error Corrections and Shared
      Modifications which You create or contribute to are automatically subject
      to the licenses granted under Section 2.2 above. You are encouraged to
      license all of Your other Modifications under Section 2.2 as Shared
      Modifications, but are not required to do so. You agree to notify
      Original Contributor of any errors in the Specification.

      b) Source Code Availability. You agree to provide all Your Error
      Corrections to Original Contributor as soon as reasonably practicable
      and, in any event, prior to Internal Deployment Use or Commercial Use, if
      applicable. Original Contributor may, at its discretion, post Source Code
      for Your Error Corrections and Shared Modifications on the Community Web
      Server. You may also post Error Corrections and Shared Modifications on a
      web-server of Your choice; provided, that You inform the Original
      Contributor and that You must take reasonable precautions to ensure that
      only Licensees have access to such Error Corrections and Shared
      Modifications. Such precautions shall include, without limitation and at
      least, a click-on, download certification of Licensee status required of
      those attempting to download from the server. An example of an acceptable
      certification is attached as Attachment A-2.

      c) Notices. All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications You create or
      contribute to must include a file documenting the additions and changes
      You made and the date of such additions and changes. If it is not
      possible to put the notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
      structure, then You must include the notice in a location (such as a
      relevant directory file), where a recipient would be most likely to look
      for such a notice.

      d) Redistribution.
      (i) Community Code. Community Code may be distributed in Source Code or
      Executable form to anybody that accepts the JCSL License conditions and
      becomes a licensee. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
      Community Code that alter the rights, requirements, or responsibilities
      of such Licensee.
      (ii) Community Code Compatibility. All Community Code must be Compliant
      Community Code prior to any Redistribution, whether originating from You
      or acquired from a third party. So if You plan to make any further Shared
      Modifications to any Community Code previously determined to be Compliant
      Community Code, you must ensure that it continues to be Compliant
      Community Code.
      (iii) Derivative Work. If You make any non shared Modifications to any
      Community Code without contributing them as Shared Modifications, You
      must clearly indicate that your distribution is a modified version of the
      official Community Code and must clearly remind to your Licensees that
      they also have to accept the JCSL License conditions on your Derivative
      Work.
      (iv) Modified Executable. You may distribute Executable version(s) of a
      Derivative Work to Licensees and other third parties only for the purpose
      of evaluation and comment in connection with Research and Development Use
      by You. You must ensure that the Executable distribution based on a
      Derivative Work carries a different mark than the JAHIA Trademarks. You
      may distribute a Derivative Work under a license of Your choice, which
      may contain terms different from this License, provided (a) that You are
      in compliance with the terms of this License, and (b) You must make it
      absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
      offered by You alone, not by Original Contributor or any other
      Contributor. Any other type of use must be subject to the execution of a
      complementary license agreement by You and Original Contributor.
      (v) Modified Class, Interface and Package Naming. In connection with
      Research and Development Use by You only, You may use Original
      Contributor's class, interface and package names only to accurately
      reference or invoke the Source Code files You modify. Original
      Contributor grants to You a limited license to the extent necessary for
      such purposes.
      (vi) Copyrights and other Attribution Notices. You must retain, in the
      Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright,
      patent, trademark, and attribution notices from Community Code, excluding
      those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your Modifications.

      (vii) You expressly agree that any distribution, in whole or in part, of
      Modifications developed by You shall only be done pursuant to the terms
      and conditions of this License.

      e) Extensions.
      (i) Community Code. You may not include any Source Code of Community Code
      in any Extensions without the prior consent of the Original Contributor;
      (ii) Open. You agree to refrain from enforcing any Intellectual Property
      Rights You may have covering any interface(s) of Your Extension, which
      would prevent the implementation of such interface(s) by Original
      Contributor or any Licensee. This obligation does not prevent You from
      enforcing any Intellectual Property Right You have that would otherwise
      be infringed by an implementation of Your Extension.
      (iii) Class, Interface and Package Naming. You may not add any packages,
      or any public or protected classes or interfaces with names that
      originate or might appear to originate from Original Contributor
      including, without limitation, package or class names which begin with
      "com.jahia", org.jahia or its equivalents in any subsequent class,
      interface and/ or package naming convention adopted by Original
      Contributor. It is specifically suggested that You name any new packages
      using the "Unique Package Naming Convention" as described in "The Java
      Language Specification" by James Gosling, Bill Joy, and Guy Steele, ISBN
      0-201-63451-1, August 1996. Section 7.7 "Unique Package Names", on page
      125 of this specification which states, in part:
      "You form a unique package name by first having (or belonging to an
      organization that has) an Internet domain name, such as "sun.com". You
      then reverse the name, component by component, to obtain, in this
      example, "com.sun", and use this as a prefix for Your package names,
      using a convention developed within Your organization to further
      administer package names."

      3.2. Additional Requirements and Responsibilities. Any additional
      requirements and responsibilities relating to the Technology are listed
      in Attachment F (Additional Requirements and Responsibilities), if
      applicable only, and are hereby incorporated into this Section 3.

      provided under a version of the License, You may always continue to use
      such Community Code under the terms of that version of the License. You
      may also choose to use such Community Code under the terms of any
      subsequent version of the License. No one other than Original Contributor
      has the right to promulgate License versions.

      4.3. Conditional Open Sourcing : If Original Contributor decides to stop
      supporting a collaborative source compliant license policy as defined by
      the Collaborative Source Initiative (www.collaborativesource.org), goes
      bankrupt or does not want to adjust this license consequently, Original
      Contributor shall release the last version available under a
