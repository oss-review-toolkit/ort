The fonts contained in this archive are Freeware. No payment is required for the use of these fonts.  They're free!
Commercial use?  Sure, but a donation or a product sample would be appreciated.

$40 US is the usual donation amount per font for commercial use but any amount is appreciated.

I make all the fonts (over 400 of them) on my web page and they're all free. I offer Deluxe versions of some of my
fonts for sale.  They contain several weights and styles of each font.  Just click on "DELUXE FONTS" at
Larabie Fonts to see them.

The site is called Larabie Fonts and it can be found at various mirror sites:

I've provided the world with over 400 free fonts, so if you'd like to make a donation I'd be more than happy to accept it.
No donation is too small.

Send anything at all to

Ray Larabie
61 Wesley Ave.
Port Credit
Ontario, CANADA
L5H 2M8

If you decide to send a cheque (that's how we spell it in Canada) make it payable to Ray Larabie.  If you want to
double check the address have a look at the donation section on any of my webpages.  If you'd like to use a credit card
to send a donation drop by my site and click on the DONATIONS section.

Canadian or US funds?  Any funds are fine with me. Whatever's easiest for you.

Here's an unofficial, non-legalese summary of the following contract:
You can use the font for commercial or non-commercial purposes. You can make things with the font, just don't change
the font itself or use it to make new fonts. You can give the font away as long as it hasn't been altered and this text file
remains with the font.  Don't remove or alter the copyright notice on the font.  Don't convert the fonts if the conversion
program alters the copyright notice.  If my font makes your hair fall out - thats' too damn bad!
