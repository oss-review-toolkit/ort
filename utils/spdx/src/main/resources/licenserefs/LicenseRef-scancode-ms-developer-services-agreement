Using Microsoft Software outside the Service. Microsoft may provide you with Microsoft Software through or as a part of the Developer Services. Termination of use of or access to the Developer Services or the termination of this Agreement terminates your right to possess or use any such Microsoft Software; and the suspension or termination of a User Plan terminates that user’s right to possess or use any such Microsoft Software that was acquired through, is attached to, or otherwise requires that User Plan.

Scope of rights. All Microsoft Software are the copyrighted works of Microsoft or its suppliers. All Microsoft Software are licensed not sold and may not be transferred unless specified otherwise in any license terms provided with the Microsoft Software. Rights to access Microsoft Software on any device do not give you any right to implement Microsoft patents or other Microsoft intellectual property in software or devices that access that device.
Third party software. You are solely responsible for any third party software that you install, connect, or use with any Service. We will not run or make any copies of such third party software outside of our relationship with you.

Your sole remedy for such changes to the Services under this Section is to terminate this Agreement.
