This agreement does not change Your rights under the laws of Your country if the laws of Your country do not permit it to do so.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software are licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using them. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions.

LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMANGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.

anything related to the software, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You because Your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
