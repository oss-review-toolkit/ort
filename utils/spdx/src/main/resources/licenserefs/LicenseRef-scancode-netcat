Netcat is entirely my own creation, although plenty of other code was used as
examples.  It is freely given away to the Internet community in the hope that
it will be useful, with no restrictions except giving credit where it is due.
No GPLs, Berkeley copyrights or any of that nonsense.  The author assumes NO
responsibility for how anyone uses it.  If netcat makes you rich somehow and
you're feeling generous, mail me a check.  If you are affiliated in any way
with Microsoft Network, get a life.  Always ski in control.  Comments,
questions, and patches to nc110-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
