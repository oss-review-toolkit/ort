AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE.

1. DEFINITIONS

          a. "Act of War" means any action of one country against any group
          either with an intention to provoke a conflict or an action that
          occurs during a declared war or during armed conflict between
          military forces of any origin. This includes but is not limited
          to enforcing sanctions or sieges, supplying armed forces,
          or profiting from the manufacture of tools or weaponry used in
          military conflict.

          b. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the
          Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
          adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other
          alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or
          performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
          other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or
          adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the
          original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will
          not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
          For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work,
          performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
          timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
          considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

          c. "Bodily Harm" means any physical hurt or injury to a person that

          selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
          intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
          entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
          contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
          in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective

2. FAIR DEALING RIGHTS

   Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
   uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
   exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
   protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. LICENSE GRANT

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby
   grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
   duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
   the Work as stated below:

          a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or
          more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in
          the Collections;

          b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
          Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
          reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
          identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
          example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
          translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
          indicate "The original work has been modified.";

          c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
          incorporated in Collections; and,

          d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. The above
          rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
          known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right
          to make such modifications as are technically necessary to
          exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to
          Section 8(g), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
          hereby reserved.

4. RESTRICTIONS

   The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and
   limited by the following restrictions:

          a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under
          the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the
          Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
          copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
          offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of
          this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to
          exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
          the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
          intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
          disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
          Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
          Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
          measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of
          the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
          recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
          applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
          does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
          made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
          Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
          extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
          required by Section 4(f), as requested. If You create an
          Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
          extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
          required by Section 4(f), as requested.

          b. If the Work meets the definition of Software, You may exercise
          the rights granted in Section 3 only if You provide a copy of the
          corresponding Source Code from which the Work was derived in digital
          form, or You provide a URI for the corresponding Source Code of
          the Work, to any recipients upon request.

          c. If the Work is used as or for a Web Service, You may exercise
          the rights granted in Section 3 only if You provide a copy of the
          corresponding Source Code from which the Work was derived in digital
          form, or You provide a URI for the corresponding Source Code to the
          Work, to any recipients of the data served or modified by the Web
          Service.

          d. You may exercise the rights granted in Section 3 for
          any purposes only if:

              i. You do not use the Work for the purpose of inflicting
              Bodily Harm on human beings (subject to criminal
              prosecution or otherwise) outside of providing medical aid.
              ii.You do not use the Work for the purpose of Surveilling
              or tracking individuals for financial gain.
              iii. You do not use the Work in an Act of War.
              iv. You do not use the Work for the purpose of supporting
              or profiting from an Act of War.
              v. You do not use the Work for the purpose of Incarceration.
              vi. You do not use the Work for the purpose of extracting
              oil, gas, or coal.
              vii. You do not use the Work for the purpose of
              expediting, coordinating, or facilitating paid work
              undertaken by individuals under the age of 12 years.
              viii. You do not use the Work to either Discriminate or
              spread Hate Speech on the basis of sex, sexual orientation,
              gender identity, race, age, disability, color, national origin,
              religion, or lower economic status.

          e. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
          Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
          made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
          for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You
          are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
          pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
          Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
          a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
          ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor!s copyright notice, terms of
          service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
          parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
          extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
          specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does
          not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
          the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of
          an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
          Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
          Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
          Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(e) may be
          implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in
          the case of an Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
          will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
          Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits
          and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
          other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may
          only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
          attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your
          rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
          assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
          by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
          appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the
          separate, express prior written permission of the Original
          Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

          f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as
          may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
          Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
          part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
          mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to
          the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
          honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
          (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
          Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
          would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or
          other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's
          honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
          appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
          the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
          exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
          make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

          g. Do not make any legal claim against anyone accusing the
          Work, with or without changes, alone or with other works,
          of infringing any patent claim.

5. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMER

   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
   OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
   KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
   LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
   ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
   THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
   YOU.

6. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY

   EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
   LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
   THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED
   OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. TERMINATION

          a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
          automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
          License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations
          or Collections from You under this License, however, will not
          have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
          entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections
          1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
          License.

          b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license
          granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
          copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor
          reserves the right to release the Work under different license
          terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
          however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
          License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
          be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License
          will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
          stated above.

8. REVISED LICENSE VERSIONS

          a. This License may receive future revisions in the original
          spirit of the license intended to strengthen This License.
          Each version of This License has an incrementing version number.

          b. Unless otherwise specified like in Section 8(c) The Licensor
          has only granted this current version of This License for The Work.
          In this case future revisions do not apply.

          c. The Licensor may specify that the latest available
          revision of This License be used for The Work by either explicitly
          writing so or by suffixing the License URI with a "+" symbol.

          d. The Licensor may specify that The Work is also available
          under the terms of This License's current revision as well
          as specific future revisions. The Licensor may do this by
          writing it explicitly or suffixing the License URI with any
          additional version numbers each separated by a comma.

9. MISCELLANEOUS

          a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
          Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
          the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
          to You under this License.

          b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
          Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
          on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
          under this License.

          c. If the Work is classified as Software, each time You Distribute
          or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient
          a copy and/or URI of the corresponding Source Code on the same
          terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

          d. If the Work is used as a Web Service, each time You Distribute
          or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, or serve data derived from the
          Software, the Licensor offers to any recipients of the data a copy
          and/or URI of the corresponding Source Code on the same terms and
          conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

          e. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
          under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
          enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
          and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
          such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
          to make such provision valid and enforceable.

          f. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived
          and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall
          be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such
          waiver or consent.

          g. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
          parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
          understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
          the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
          additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
          You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
          agreement of the Licensor and You.

          h. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced,
          in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the
          Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
          Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of
          1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances
          and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
          Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and
          subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
          the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the
          corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty
          provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite
          of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
