Terms of Agreement


1. Definitions
	a) "Original Code" means:
The original version of the program accompanying this Agreement as
released by Opera Software ASA ("OPERA") , including source code, object
code and documentation, if any.
	b) "Covered Code" means:
The Original Source Code, Contributions, the combination of the Original
Code and Contributions, and/or any respective portions thereof.
	c) "Contribution" means:
in the case of OPERA, the Original Code, and
in the case of each Contributor, changes to the Original code, and
additions to the Original Code; where such changes and/or additions to
the Original Code originate from and are distributed by that particular
Contributor.  A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was
added to the Original Code by such Contributor itself or anyone acting
on such Contributor's behalf.
Contributions do not include additions to the Original Code which: (i)
are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
Original Code under their own license agreement, and (ii)  are not
derivative works of the Original Code.
	d) "Contributor" means:
OPERA and any other entity that distributes the Covered Code.
	e) "Recipient" means:
Anyone who receives the Covered Code under this Agreement, including all
Contributors.
	f) "Larger Work" means:
A work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code not
governed by the terms of this Agreement, specifically additions to the
Original Code which: (i)  are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Original Code under their own license agreement,
and (ii)  are not derivative works of the Original Code.


2. Grant of Rights
	a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
The limited license granted in this Section is only for the integration
of the Contribution with or for the use of the Contribution in
connection with other proprietary software of OPERA, including but not
limited to OPERA’s browser software.
	b) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.  Each
Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
or otherwise.  As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
	c) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
license set forth in this Agreement.

conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of

Agreement must be included with each copy of the Covered Code.
		ii. Each Contributor must duplicate, to the extent it does not already
exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Covered Code of all
Contributions, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that the contributor changed the files and the date of any
change.
		iii. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator
of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
becoming aware of such noncompliance.  If all Recipient's rights under
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
of the Covered Code as soon as reasonably practicable.  However,
Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by
Recipient relating to the Covered Code shall continue and survive.

OPERA may publish new versions (including revisions)  of this Agreement
from time to time.  Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number.  The Covered Code (including
Contributions)  may always be distributed subject to the version of the
Agreement under which it was received.  In addition, after a new version
of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Covered Code (including its Contributions)  under the new version.  No one
other than OPERA has the right to modify this Agreement.  Except as
expressly stated in Section 2(a) , Recipient receives no rights or
licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.  All
rights in the Covered Code not expressly granted under this Agreement
are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of Norway.  Any and all disputes
arising out of the rights and obligations in this Agreement shall be
submitted to ordinary court proceedings.  You accept the Oslo City Court
