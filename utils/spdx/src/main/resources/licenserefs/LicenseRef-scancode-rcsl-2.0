3. Requirements and Responsibilities.

3.1 Research Use License.

As a condition of exercising the rights granted under Section 2.1(a) above, You must comply with the following:

(a) Your Contributions. All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications which You create are automatically subject to the licenses granted under Section 2.2 above.

You must also include the notice set forth in Attachment A-1 in the file header. If it is not possible to put the notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include the notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file), where a recipient would be most likely to look for such a notice.

(d) Redistribution.

(i) Source. Covered Code may be distributed in Source Code form only to another Licensee (except for students as provided below). You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Code that alter the rights, requirements, or responsibilities of such Licensee. You may distribute Covered Code to students for use in connection with their course work and research projects undertaken at accredited educational institutions. Such students need not be Licensees, but must be given a copy of the notice set forth in Attachment A-3 and such notice must also be included in a file header or prominent location in the Source Code made available to such students.

(ii) Executable. You may distribute Executable version(s) of Covered Code to Licensees and other third parties only for the purpose of evaluation and comment in connection with Research Use by You and under a license of Your choice, but which limits use of such Executable version(s) of Covered Code only to that purpose.

(iii) Modified Class, Interface and Package Naming. In connection with Research Use by You only, You may use Original Contributor's class, Interface and package names only to accurately reference or invoke the Source Code files You modify. Original Contributor grants to You a limited license to the extent necessary for such purposes.

(e) Extensions.

(i) You may not include any Source Code of Community Code in any Extensions. You may include the compiled Header Files of Community Code in an Extension provided that Your use of the Covered Code, including Header Files, complies with the TCK and all other terms of this License.

(ii) Open. You must refrain from enforcing any Intellectual Property Rights You may have covering any interface(s) of Your Extension, which would prevent the implementation of such interface(s) by Original Contributor or any Licensee. This obligation does not prevent You from enforcing any Intellectual Property Right You have that would otherwise be infringed by an implementation of Your Extension.

(iii) Interface Modifications and Naming. You may not modify or add to the GUID space "xxxxxxxx-0901-11d1-8B06-00A024406D59" or any other GUID space designated by Original Contributor.
