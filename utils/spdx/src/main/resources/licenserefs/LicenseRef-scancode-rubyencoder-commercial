If any part of the above limitations or exclusions is held to be void or unenforceable, such part shall be deemed to be deleted from this Licence Agreement and the remainder of the limitation or exclusion shall continue in full force and effect.

The licence is effective until terminated. You may terminate it at any time by destroying the Materials together with all copies in any form.

You agree upon such termination to destroy the Materials together with all copies in any form.

13. Export
You will comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations governing export of goods and information, including the laws of the countries in which the Materials were created.

14.4. Failure or neglect by either party to exercise any of its rights or remedies under this Licence Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of that party's rights nor in any way affect the validity of the whole or part of this Licence Agreement nor prejudice that party's right to take subsequent action.
