1. Registration.

Customer may be required to register and establish an account in order to access and use Splunk Materials. If so, Customer must: (i) provide true, accurate, current and complete information on the applicable registration form (collectively, the “Registration Data”) and (ii) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to ensure that it remains true, accurate, current and complete. If we have reasonable grounds to suspect that your information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your account and/or disable and prohibit any and all current or future access to and use of all or any portion of the Splunk Materials by you. Customer must provide a valid email address for each person authorized to use Customer’s account. Each person who uses the Service must have a separate username and password. Customer must provide any other information requested by Splunk in order to complete the registration process. Customer will maintain (and is responsible for maintaining) the confidentiality of the user name, password and other Registration Data associated with its account. Customer may not share Customer passwords or access codes with a third party. Customer is responsible for any access and use of the Splunk Materials via Customer’s or its User’s accounts and for all activities that occur in connection with Customer’s or its User’s accounts, regardless of whether the activities were undertaken by Customer, its User, or a third party. Splunk will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from Customer’s (or one or more of its User’s) failure to comply with this Section, including any loss or damage arising from the failure to (a) maintain the confidentiality of a user name, password or other Registration Data, (b) immediately notify Splunk of any unauthorized access to or use of Customer’s password or account or any other breach of security, and (c) ensure that Customer exits from its account at the end of each session. Customer agrees to notify Splunk immediately if it believes that an unauthorized third party may be using Customer’s account or if Customer’s account information is lost or stolen. Customer is solely responsible for its Users’ compliance with the Agreement.

2. Service.

Splunk will make the Service available to you during the term of this Agreement. Subject to and conditioned on Customer’s continuing compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Customer may (i) access and use the Site and the Services in accordance with the Documentation and this Agreement and in connection with Customer’s use of the designated Splunk software product or service, and (ii) access and use the results, reports and other information generated with respect to the performance of the Customer App that is made available to Customer through the Services (including copies of such results, reports and other information), in each case to monitor, maintain and improve the Customer App.  Customer is responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telecommunications, broadband and computer equipment and services needed to access and use the Service and for paying all charges related thereto, including, without limitation, Internet service provider fees, telecommunications fees, and the costs of any equipment and third-party software (including, without limitation, encryption and other security technology).

3. Software.

3.1. License to Software. Access to the Service may require or allow for use of one or more Software applications offered by Splunk. Use of all Software is subject to the end user license agreement provided or referenced by Splunk in connection with such Software. In the case of the Splunk SDK, the following would apply: Subject to and conditioned on Customer’s continuing compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation compliance with the obligations regarding the End User Requirements, Splunk hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, revocable, royalty-free license (without the right to sublicense except as expressly permitted by this Section) to: (i) install, use, and copy the Splunk SDK for the purpose of debugging, monitoring, developing and operating the Customer App, and (ii) include the Splunk SDK in the Customer App and distribute to End Users (directly or indirectly in accordance with Customer’s regular distribution channels for the Customer App) the Splunk SDK as contained within the Customer App. Unless otherwise stated on the download page, this license to the Splunk SDK is perpetual, but you may not be able to view data or results generated by the Splunk SDK if the Service is terminated or expired.

3.2. End User Requirements. For each distribution and copy of the Customer App that contains the Splunk SDK, Customer will require the applicable End User to enter into a legally binding license agreement with Customer that, at a minimum, complies with the following criteria (“End User Requirements”): (a) limits the license grant to use of the Customer App by the End User on the applicable mobile device(s) on a specified mobile platform or on applicable web browsers; (b) disclaims all warranties by and on behalf of Splunk; (c) limits all liabilities of Splunk; (d) prohibits decompilation and other reverse engineering of the Splunk Materials; (e) provides that Customer will protect the privacy and legal rights of End Users under all applicable laws and regulations, which includes communicating a legally adequate privacy notice; (f) notifies End Users that certain information will be made available to Customer, Splunk and other entities and that additional charges (e.g., data usage charges) may be incurred by End Users (e.g., in the transmission of such information) by their mobile service providers or internet service providers; (g) obtains sufficient authorization from End Users to transfer such information to Customer, Splunk and other entities and to permit the storage and processing of such information; and (h) otherwise obtains and maintains any required consents from End Users to allow Splunk (including its service providers) to provide or have provided the Services, including without limitation consent for Customer, Splunk and other entities to access, monitor, use and disclose End User data. In the license agreement with End Users, Customer will not refer to Splunk by name or with other identifying information; instead, Customer will address the End User Requirements by referring to its “suppliers,” “licensors” and “service providers” (or using similar words that refer to Splunk).

4. License Restrictions.

In all circumstances, as a condition to Customer’s access to and use of the Splunk Materials, Customer agrees that it will not access or use the Splunk Materials (or any content or other materials accessed through the Splunk Materials) for any purpose that is unlawful or in any manner which could damage, disable, overburden or impair the operation of the Splunk Materials (or the networks connected to or used for the Site or the Services) or interfere with any other party’s use of the Splunk Materials. Splunk may take whatever steps we believe are appropriate, at our sole discretion, to detect and prevent any such activities. Further, Splunk may take whatever steps we believe are appropriate, at our sole discretion, to enforce or verify compliance with any part of this Agreement (including, without limitation, our right to pursue or cooperate with any legal process relating to Customer’s use of the Splunk Materials or any third party claim that Customer’s use of the Splunk Materials is unlawful or infringes such third party’s rights). If Customer fails to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Customer’s right to use the Splunk Materials automatically terminates. Splunk reserves the right to deny Customer’s access to and use of the Splunk Materials if Customer fails to comply with such terms and conditions or if Customer is the subject of complaints by others.

Notices that are provided by posting on the Site will be effective three (3) days after posting.

9. Feedback.

In the event that Customer provides any Feedback to Splunk (including through the Site or the Services), Customer hereby grants to Splunk a perpetual, irrevocable, world-wide, royalty free, fully paid-up, unrestricted right and license to use, make, have made, offer for sale, sell, copy, distribute (through multiple tiers of distribution), publicly perform or display, import, export, transmit, create derivative works of, and otherwise exploit such Feedback as part of or in connection with any Splunk product, service, technology, content, material, specification or documentation, in any manner Splunk deems fit. Splunk, in its sole discretion, may or may not respond to Customer’s Feedback or promise to address all of Customer’s Feedback in the development of future features or functionalities of the Splunk Materials or any related or subsequent versions of the Splunk Materials.

10. Third-Party Content.

The Site and the Services may contain links to other websites, apps or content operated or provided by third parties. Such web sites, apps and content are not under the control of Splunk. Splunk is not responsible for such websites, apps and content or any links contained in any third-party website, app or content. Splunk provides these links only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to the third-party websites, apps or content. Further, Splunk is not responsible for any content or materials posted on the Site or through the Service by you or our other customers or users of the Site. Any opinions and views stated are those of the individuals making them and do not reflect our opinions and views. Information submitted by others may not be verified or reviewed in any way before it appears on the Site or through the Services. Therefore, we do not warrant the validity or accuracy of any such information. Please use caution and common sense when using the Site or the Services. In no way do we endorse the content or legality of any offers, statements, or promises made by any other parties on or off the Site or as part of or separate from the Services.

11. Confidentiality.

11.1. Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but in no event less than reasonable care). The Receiving Party agrees (i) not to use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement, and (ii) except as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, to limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its and its Affiliates’ employees, contractors, and agents who need such access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who have confidentiality obligations to the Receiving Party containing protections no less stringent than those herein.

11.2. Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party’s cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a Party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.

12. Warranty Disclaimer.

SPLUNK AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, PROVIDE THE SITE, SERVICES AND SOFTWARE AS-IS AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT ANY QUIET ENJOYMENT AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. SPLUNK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITE, SERVICES OR SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, NOR DOES SPLUNK PROVIDE ANY WARRANTIES AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE SITE, SERVICES OR SOFTWARE, OR THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THE SITE OR BY THE SERVICES. YOU AGREE THAT, AS BETWEEN YOU AND SPLUNK, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCURACY AND QUALITY OF THE DATA PROVIDED BY YOU OR YOUR END USERS TO SPLUNK AND ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. Because this disclaimer of warranty may not be valid in some states or jurisdictions, the above disclaimer may not apply to you.

The Splunk Materials, or any feature or part thereof, may not be available for use in all jurisdictions, and Splunk makes no representation that the Splunk Materials, or any feature or part thereof is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. To the extent Customer chooses to access and use the Splunk Materials, Customer does so at Customer’s own initiative and at Customer’s own risk, and Customer is responsible for complying with any applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

13. Limitation of Liability.

SPLUNK AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS AND LICENSORS (THE “SPLUNK ENTITIES”) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, CONTENT, DATA, SECURITY OF DATA, OR LOSS OF OTHER INTANGIBLES, OR THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, EVEN IF SPLUNK HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. FURTHER, THE SPLUNK ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LIABILITY OR DAMAGES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH OR RESULTING FROM: (I) CUSTOMER USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF ANY: (A) TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF CUSTOMER ACCOUNT, OR (B) ANY UNANTICIPATED OR UNSCHEDULED DOWNTIME FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF POWER OUTAGES, SYSTEM FAILURES, OR OTHER INTERRUPTIONS, OR (C) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OR GOODS, OR (D) ANY INVESTMENT, EXPENDITURE, OR COMMITMENT BY CUSTOMER IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR CUSTOMER’S USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE; (II) ANY CHANGES MADE TO THE SERVICE OR ANY TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT CESSATION OF THE SERVICE OR ANY PART THEREOF; (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, ALTERATION OF, OR DELETION OF CUSTOMER CONTENT; (IV) THE DELETION OF, DESTRUCTION, DAMAGE, LOSS, CORRUPTION OF, OR FAILURE TO STORE, SEND OR RECEIVE ANY CUSTOMER CONTENT, TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE; (V) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE; AND (VI) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICE. IN ANY CASE, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE SPLUNK ENTITIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO US$100. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. To the extent such a law applies to Customer, some or all of the exclusions or limitations set forth above may not apply to Customer, and Customer may have additional rights. Splunk is acting on behalf of its Affiliates and their licensors, suppliers and service providers for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and limiting obligations, warranties and liabilities, but in no other respects and for no other purposes.

14. Support; Modification of Site or Services.

Splunk reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify the Splunk Materials or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Site or any of the Services (or any part thereof). Splunk will not be liable to Customer or any other user or other third party for any such modification or discontinuance. If you do not agree to the modification or discontinuance and the modification or discontinuance is material, you may terminate this Agreement by providing us with notice of termination within thirty (30) days after the earlier of (i) the modification or discontinuance or (ii) our notice to you of the modification or discontinuance. On providing notice of termination, you will cease all access to and use of the Splunk Materials and we will have no obligation to provide any further Splunk Materials to you. If Splunk permanently discontinues the Services, and there remains a period for which you have paid fees in advance for access to and use of the Services, we will provide you with a refund or credit (for use with other products or services of Splunk or its affiliates) of a pro rata portion of the fees you paid in advance but unused.
