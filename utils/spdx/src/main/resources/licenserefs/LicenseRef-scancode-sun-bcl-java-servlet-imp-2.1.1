Java Servlet Implementation Classes
Version 2.1.1
Binary Code License

This binary code license ("License") contains rights and restrictions
associated with use of the accompanying Java Servlet Implementation Classes
software and documentation ("Software").  Read the License carefully before
using the Software.  By using the Software you agree to the terms and
conditions of this License.

 1. Limited License Grant.  By agreeing to this License, Sun grants to you
    ("Licensee") a non-exclusive, nontransferable limited license to use the
    Software without fee for evaluation of the Software and for development
    of applications which utilize the Software.  Licensee may make one archival
    copy of the Software and may redistribute complete, unmodified copies of
    the Software to software developers within the Licensee's organization to
    avoid unnecessary download time provided that this License conspicuously
    appear with all copies of the Software.  Except for the foregoing and the
    distribution rights authorized for the Servlet Classes specified below,
    Licensee may not redistribute the Software in whole or in part, either
    separately or included with a product.

 2. License to Distribute Servlet Classes.  Licensee is granted a royalty-free
    right to reproduce and distribute the binary code form of the servlet
    classes contained in the Software in the archive file "servlet.jar"
    ("Servlet Classes"), provided that Licensee: (i) distributes the Servlet
    Classes complete and unmodified in their original Java Archive file, and
    only as a part of Licensee's application that incorporates the Servlet
    Classes ("Program"); (ii) does not distribute additional software intended
    to replace any components of the Servlet Classes; (iii) agrees to
    incorporate the most current version of the Servlet Classes that was
    available from Sun no later than 180 days prior to each production release
    of Program; (iv) does not remove or alter any proprietary legends or
    notices contained in the Servlet Classes; (v) includes the provisions of
    Sections 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 in Licensee's license agreement for the Program;
    and (vi) agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Sun and its
    licensors from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorneys'
    fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of the Software.

 3. Java Platform Interface.  Licensee may not modify the Java Platform
    Interface (JPI, identified as classes contained within the javax package
    or any subpackages of the javax package), by creating additional classes
    within the JPI or otherwise causing the addition to or modification of
    the classes in the JPI.  In the event that Licensee creates any
    Java-related API and distribute such API to others for applet or
    application development, you must promptly publish broadly, an accurate
    specification for such API for free use by all developers of Java-based
    software.

  4. Restrictions.  Software is confidential copyrighted information of Sun and
     title to all copies is retained by Sun and/or its licensors.  Licensee
     shall not modify, decompile, disassemble, decrypt, extract, or otherwise
     reverse engineer Software.  Software may not be leased, assigned, or
     sublicensed, in whole or in part.  Software is not designed or intended
     for use in on-line control of aircraft, air traffic, aircraft navigation
     or aircraft communications; or in the design, construction, operation or
     maintenance of any nuclear facility.  Licensee warrants that it will not
     use or redistribute the Software for such purposes.

  5. Trademarks and Logos.  This License does not authorize Licensee to use any
     Sun name,    trademark or logo.  Licensee acknowledges that Sun owns the
     Java trademark and all Java- related trademarks, logos and icons including
     the Coffee Cup and Duke ("Java Marks") and agrees to: (i) to comply with
     the Java Trademark Guidelines at http://java.sun.com/ trademarks.html;
     (ii) not do anything harmful to or inconsistent with Sun's rights in the
     Java Marks; and (iii) assist Sun in protecting those rights, including
     assigning to Sun any rights acquired by Licensee in any Java Mark.

  6. Disclaimer of Warranty.  Software is provided "AS IS," without a warranty
     of any kind.    ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,
     INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED.

  7. Limitation of Liability.  SUN AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
     ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY AS A RESULT OF USING
     OR DISTRIBUTING SOFTWARE.  IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE
     LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT,
     SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED
     AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR
     INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
     OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  8. Termination.  This License is effective until terminated.  Licensee may
     terminate this License at any time by destroying all copies of Software.
     This License will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if Licensee
     fails to comply with any provision of this License.  Upon such termination,
     Licensee must destroy all copies of Software.

  9. Export Regulations.  Software, including technical data, is subject to U.S.
     export control laws, including the U.S.  Export Administration Act and its
     associated regulations, and may be subject to export or import regulations
     in other countries.  Licensee agrees to comply strictly with all such
     regulations and acknowledges that it has the responsibility to obtain
     licenses to export, re-export, or import Software.  Software may not be
     downloaded, or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into, or to a national
     or resident of, Cuba, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Libya, Sudan, Syria or any
     country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on the
     U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nations or the U.S.
     Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders.

  10. Restricted Rights.  Use, duplication or disclosure by the United States
     government is subject to the restrictions as set forth in the Rights in
     Technical Data and Computer Software Clauses in DFARS 252.227-7013(c)
     (1) (ii) and FAR 52.227-19(c) (2) as applicable.

  11. Governing Law.  Any action related to this License will be governed by
     California law and controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules
     of any jurisdiction will apply.

  12. Severability.  If any of the above provisions are held to be in
     violation of applicable law, void, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
     then such provisions are herewith waived to the extent necessary for the
     License to be otherwise enforceable in such jurisdiction.  However, if in
     Sun's opinion deletion of any provisions of the License by operation of
     this paragraph unreasonably compromises the rights or increase the
     liabilities of Sun or its licensors, Sun reserves the right to terminate
     the License and refund the fee paid by Licensee, if any, as Licensee's
     sole and exclusive remedy.

  13. Integration. This Agreement is the entire agreement between Licensee and
     Sun relating to its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or
     contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations
     and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of
     any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the
     parties relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.
     No modification of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and
     signed by an authorized representative of each party.
