If You or Your affiliates choose to assert Your Patents against OEM/ODM Licensees on account of the OEM/ODM Licensees making, use, sale, offer for sale, importation or other disposition or promotion of Windows CE, portion thereof, or a redistributed portion thereof, then You and Your affiliates agree to offer licenses to such OEM/ODM Licensees under commercially reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and pricing.
